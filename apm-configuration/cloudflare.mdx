This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on applications deployed through Cloudflare Workers. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code [here](https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/cloudflare).

## Prerequisites

`Wrangler version 2.2.2`. Check your Wrangler version with the following command:
```bash Shell
wrangler version
```

# Install

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install Middleware Package">
Run the following command in your terminal.
```bash Shell
npm i @middleware.io/agent-apm-worker 
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Import Tracker">
```javascript JavaScript
import { init,track } from '@middleware.io/agent-apm-worker';
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Initialize Tracker">
The access token is your account key, which can be found on the Installation page. To watch instrumented logs in the terminal, set consoleLogEnabled: true.
```javascript JavaScript
init({
   serviceName:"{APM-SERVICE-NAME}",
   accountKey:"{ACCOUNT_KEY}",
   target:"https://{ACCOUNT-UID}.middleware.io",
   consoleLogEnabled:false,
});
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Track Requests with the Middleware SDK">
```javascript JavaScript
const sdk = track(request, ctx);
sdk.sendResponse(response);
```  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 5: Enable Logging">
```javascript JavaScript
// sdk.logger.SEVERITY( MESSAGE, KEY-VALUE PAIRS )

sdk.logger.error("error test")
sdk.logger.error("error with attributes",{"log.file.name":"error.log"})
sdk.logger.info("info test")
sdk.logger.debug("debug test")
sdk.logger.warn("warn test")
```
</Accordion>

# Continuous Profiling

Continuous profiling captures real-time performance insights from your application to enable rapid identification of resource allocation, bottlenecks, and more. The following table describes the available features offered by the continuous profiler for the Cloudflare APM.

Continuous Profiling for the Cloudflare APM is not yet available; reach out to our support team if you'd like more information. Navigate to the [Continuous Profiling](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/profiling#continuous-profiling) section to learn more about using Continuous Profiling with our other APMs.
