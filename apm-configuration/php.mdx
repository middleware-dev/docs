This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on a PHP application. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code [here](https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/php).

<Warning> The Laravel and CakePHP web frameworks are not currently supported by the PHP APM. </Warning> 

# Prerequisites

<Steps>

  <Step title="Infra Agent">
   Infrastructure Agent (Infra Agent). To install the Infra Agent, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview).
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="PHP Version">
    `PHP version 8.2` or above. Check your PHP version with the following command:
    ```shell Shell
    php -v
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Install

### Step 1: Install `PHP` Extensions

#### Step 1a: Install Pecl & Composer
- [Pecl](https://pecl.php.net/) Installation
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) Installation


#### Step 1b: Install `otel-instrumentation`

```bash Shell
sudo pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/opentelemetry-1.0.0beta3
```

#### Step 1c: Add Extension to `php.ini` File

```php php
[opentelemetry]
extension=opentelemetry.so
```

The `php.ini` file can be found using the following commands based on your Linux distribution:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu/Debian
sudo nano /etc/php/<php_version>/cli/php.ini
```

```bash CentOS/RHEL
sudo nano /etc/php.ini
```

```bash Arch Linux
sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini
```

```bash Web-Serve
sudo nano /etc/php/<php_version>/apache2/php.ini
```
</CodeGroup>


#### Step 1d: Verify Installation

Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
```bash Shell
php -m | grep opentelemetry
```

### Step 2: Install `PHP` APM Package

Ensure you have a PHP project set up and a `composer.json` file in your project’s root directory. 

<Note> If you do not have a `composer.json` file already created, create one using using the `composer init` command.</Note>

To install the Middleware APM package, run the following command:

```bash Shell
composer update
composer require middleware/agent-apm-php
```

### Step 3: Import Tracker

Add following code to the beginning of your project:

```php PHP
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Middleware\AgentApmPhp\MwTracker;
```

### Step 4: Container Variables

#### Docker 

<Note> Applications running in a container require an additional environment variable. If your application is not running in a container, move to Step 5. </Note>

For Docker containers, add the following environment variable to your application.
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=<DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS>
```
<Note> The `DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS` is the IP address of the gateway between the Docker host and bridge network. This is `172.17.0.1` by default. 
Learn more about Docker bridge networking [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) </Note>

#### Kubernetes 

```bash Shell
kubectl get service --all-namespaces | grep mw-service
```

Then add the following environment variable to your application deployment YAML file. 
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local
```

### Step 5: Implement APM Collector

Start a tracing scope at the beginning of your code. 

```php PHP
$tracker = new MwTracker('<PROJECT-NAME>', '<SERVICE-NAME>');
$tracker->preTrack();
```

Define hooks with class and function names beneath the tracing scope.
```php Shell
$tracker->registerHook('<CLASS-NAME-1>', '<FUNCTION-NAME-1>', [
    'custom.attr1' => 'value1',
    'custom.attr2' => 'value2',
]);
$tracker->registerHook('<CLASS-NAME-2>', '<FUNCTION-NAME-2>');
```

End the tracing scope after your code. 
```php PHP
$tracker->postTrack();
```

### Step 6: Enable Logging

To ingest custom logs, utilize the following functions based on desired log severity levels.
 ```php PHP
   $tracker->warn("this is warning log.");
   $tracker->error("this is error log.");
   $tracker->info("this is info log.");
   $tracker->debug("this is debug log.");
```

# Troubleshooting

Below we cover a few common errors and their solutions. 

### `pecl: command not found error`

If you receive a `pecl: command not found error`, run the following command:
```bash Shell
sudo apt-get update
apt-get install php-pear php8.1-dev
```

### Broken Dependency Issue

If you receive any broken dependency issues, including errors like `libpcre2-dev : Depends: libpcre2-8-0 / libpcre2-16-0 / libpcre2-32-0`, run the following command:
```bash Shell
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

### `ERROR: ‘phpize’ failed error`

If you receive an `ERROR: ‘phpize’ failed error`, run the following commands:
```bash Shell
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install php8.1-dev

sudo apt-get update
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
```

# Azure Pipelines

The Azure Pipelines continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) infrastructure helps you build, deploy, and test your PHP projects. For information on setting up your PHP project with Azure Pipelines and Azure DevOps Services, learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/php?view=azure-devops). 

### Step 1: Configure OpenTelemetry Extension

Add the following code to your `.ini` file located in the `/home/html/ini` directory of your Azure account:

```otel OpenTelemetry Extension
extension=opentelemetry.so
```

### Step 2: Add Configuration to Azure

Navigate to Application Settings in your Azure PHP project account and select `New application setting`. Add the following Name and Value to the `New application setting`:

```
Name: PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR
Value: /home/html/ini
```

Your configuration should look like the following:

### Step 3: Create Your Build Pipelines

Update your build pipeline by adding the following code to the `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

<Note> The below build pipeline includes installation steps for `Opentelemetry` and the `middleware/agent-apm-php` </Note>

```yaml YAML
trigger:
- master

variables:
  # Azure Resource Manager connection created during pipeline creation
  azureSubscription: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'

  # Web app name
  webAppName: 'php-apm-test'

  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'

  # Environment name
  environmentName: 'php-apm-test'

  # Root folder under which your composer.json file is available.
  rootFolder: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)

        if [ "$(pecl list | grep opentelemetry)" ]; then
          echo "Opentelemetry package is already installed. Skipping this installation."
        else
          sudo pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/opentelemetry-1.0.0beta3
        fi

        if php -m | grep opentelemetry; then
          echo "Opentelemetry extension is enabled."
        else
          echo "Opentelemetry extension is not enabled. Please add it to your php.ini file: extension=opentelemetry.so"
          exit 1
        fi
      workingDirectory: $(rootFolder)
      displayName: 'Verify Opentelemetry Extension'

    - script: composer update
      workingDirectory: $(rootFolder)
      displayName: 'Update Composer'

    - script: |
        # Check if the Middleware PHP APM-Package is already listed in the composer
        if composer show | grep middleware/agent-apm-php; then
          echo "Middleware APM-Package is already listed in the composer file. Skipping this installation."
        else
          composer require middleware/agent-apm-php
        fi
      workingDirectory: $(rootFolder)
      displayName: 'Install Middleware PHP APM-Package'

    - task: ArchiveFiles@2
      displayName: 'Archive files'
      inputs:
        rootFolderOrFile: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
        includeRootFolder: false
        archiveType: zip
        archiveFile: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/$(Build.BuildId).zip
        replaceExistingArchive: true

    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      inputs:
        PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
        ArtifactName: 'drop'
        publishLocation: 'Container'
```

### Step 4: Check Your Pipeline

The PHP Agent is now set up to execute a CI/CD approach, following the build pipeline configuration, whenever new code is pushed to the production environment. 

Your output should look like the following:
