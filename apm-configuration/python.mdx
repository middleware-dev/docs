This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on a Python application. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code <a href="https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/python"> here </a>.


## Prerequisites

1. Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent), to install the MW Agent please see our <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview"> installation guide. </a> 

2. `Python 3 version 3.8` or above recommended. Check your Python version:
```bash Shell
python3 --version
```

3. `pip version 23.1.2` or above. Check your pip version:
```bash Shell
pip --version
```

## Step 1: Install Middleware Python APM Package
Run the following command in your terminal:
```python Shell
pip install middleware-apm
```

## Step 2: Import Middleware Tracker
Add the following lines to the beginning of your application:

```python Python 3
import logging 
 
from middleware import MwTracker
tracker=MwTracker()
```

## Step 3: Container Variables (Optional)
Applications running in a container require an additional environment variable. If your application is not running in a container, move to Step 4. 

For Docker containers, add the following environment variable to your application:
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=<DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS>
```
<Note> docker bridge gateway address is the IP address of the gateway between the Docker host and the bridge network, which is 172.17.0.1 by default. 
Refer more about Docker bridge networking [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) </Note>

For Kubernetes, first identify the namespace where the MW Agent is running:

```bash Shell
kubectl get service --all-namespaces | grep mw-service
```

Then add the following environment variable to your application deployment YAML file:
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local
```

## Step 4: Capture Application Data



### Setup .ini File

Create a `.ini` file based on the features you want to observe. `service_name` and `access_token` are required for the tracker to send data to Middleware.

```python .ini
[middleware.common]

# The name of your application as service-name, as it will appear in the UI to filter out your data.
service_name = {APM-SERVICE-NAME}

# This Token binds the Python Agent's data and profiling data to your account.
access_token = {YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN}

# The service name, where Middleware Agent is running, in case of K8s.
mw_agent_service = mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local

# Distributed traces for your application (false = disabled).
collect_traces = true

# Collection of metrics for your application (false = disabled).
collect_metrics = true

# Collection of logs for your application (false = disabled).
collect_logs = true

# Collection of profiling data for your application (false = disabled).
collect_profiling = true
```
### Enable Custom Logs

To ingest custom logs, utilize the following functions based on desired log severity levels:

```python Python 3
logging.info("info sample")
logging.warning("Sample Warning Log") 
logging.error("Sample Error Log.", extra={'tester': 'Alex'})
```

### Stack Errors
Use `tracker.record_error()` method to record a stack trace when an error occurs:

```python Python 3
try:
    not_possible = 12/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    tracker.record_error(e)
```

## Step 5: Start Your Project
After deploying your application, run the following command to start your project:
```shell Shell
MIDDLEWARE_CONFIG_FILE=./middleware.ini middleware-apm run python app.py
```
