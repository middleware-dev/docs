# Continuous Profiling

Continuous profiling captures real-time performance insights from your application to enable rapid identification of resource allocation, bottlenecks, and more. Navigate to the [Continuous Profiling](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/profiling#continuous-profiling) section to learn more about using Continuous Profiling with the Ruby APM.
