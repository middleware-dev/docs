More advanced users have the option to use OpenTelemetry Protocol Exporters instead of Middleware's Agent and associated SDKs to ingest data. Each language will have a different approach which can be an adaptation from our relevant Host Agent.

The example below uses JavaScript and an abstraction from our [Node Agent](https://github.com/middleware-labs/agent-apm-nodejs). All other agents can be found in our [middleware-labs repo](https://github.com/middleware-labs). If you need assistance with a specific language we are happy to work with you, however, we do not have every approach documented at this time.

<Warning>Instrument your OpenTelemetry code with languages that are supported by both Middleware and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/).</Warning>

# Installation

### Step 1: Setup Resource Attributes

Embed OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes:
<Note> Learn more about OpenTelemetry Resources [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/resources/). </Note>

```javascript JavaScript
const resource = new Resource({
  [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: "YOUR_SERVICE-NAME",
  ["mw_agent"]: true,
  ["mw.account_key"]: "YOUR-API-KEY",
  ["mw_target"]: "YOUR-TARGET"
});
```
### Resource Attributes

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :--: |:--:| :---: | :----:| 
| `mw.account_key` | string | ✅ | API key that authenticates your MW Account |
| `mw_agent` | boolean |✅ | Required by MW |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | string | ✅ | Logical name of service requred by OpenTelemetry | 

<Note> For more information on OpenTelemetry JavaScript Resources, head [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/resources/) </Note>


### Step 2: Configure your Exporter

Configure your exporter(s) to send data to Middleware with `OTLP/HTTP` or `OTLP/gRPC`. 

<Warning> Log ingestion is an experimental feature within Open Telemetry. Proceed with caution. </Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript OTLP/gRPC
// Install gRPC exporter libraries
const { OTLPLogExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-grpc");
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc");
const { OTLPMetricExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc");

// Place the following in your global SDK
// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC logger endpoint
const loggerExporter = new OTLPLogExporter({
  url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC metric endpoint
const metricExporter = new OTLPMetricExporter({
    url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC trace endpoint
const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

```

```javascript OTLP/HTTP
// Send HTTP POST requests to endpoints:
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/logs
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/traces
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/metrics
```
