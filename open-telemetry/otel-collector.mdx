The following document describes how to natively configure the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution with the Middleware platform.

Use the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib to build your own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/), send host data without using the Middleware Host Agent, or send host data from a technology that doesnt have a native Middleware Integration.

<Note> The Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution is not available and in development. </Note>

# Linux Installation

### Step 1: Install DEB or RPM

[Download](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/#linux) the `opentelemetry-collector` with the same package manager you used to install the MW Agent.

### Step 2: Use `otelcol-contrib`

Use the `otelcol-contrib (opentelemetry-collector-contrib)` distribution instead of the `otelcol (opentelemetry-collector)` for the OpenTelemetry Collector.

When prompted to download `otelcol`, download one of the following instead:

<CodeGroup>

```powershell DEB
# AMD64
otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_amd64.deb
# ARM64
otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_arm64.deb
```

```powershell RPM
# AMD64
otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_amd64.rpm 
# ARM64
otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_arm64.rpm
```

</CodeGroup>  

### Step 3: Follow OTel Config

Once you have installed Linux, proceed to the [Configuration Section](/open-telemetry/otel-collector#configuration).

# Docker Installation

### Step 1: Install DockerHub or `ghcr.io`

[Download](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/) the opentelemetry-collector with the same container registry you used to install the MW Agent.

### Step 2: Use `otelcol-contrib`

Ensure the container image refers to the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` and not core `opentelemetry-collector`.

Check your container image with the following commands:

```Shell Shell
otelcol --version
# and
opentelemetry-collector-contrib --version
```

### Step 3: Follow OTel Config

Once you have installed Docker, proceed to the [Configuration Section](/open-telemetry/otel-collector#configuration).

# Configuration

### Step 1: Configure Collector
Follow the [OTel Configuration Instructions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) to configure the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib`

<Note> You must fully configure the OTel Collector before adding more code to the `processors`, `exporters` and `service` section. </Note>

### Step 2: Add to Processors

Add the following code to the `processors` section:

```YAML YAML
processors:
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [ env, system ]
    timeout: 2s
    system:
      hostname_sources: [ os ]
  resource/middleware:
    attributes:
    - action: upsert
      key: mw.account_key
      value: <your-mw-api-key>
    - action: upsert
      from_attribute: host.name
      key: host.id
```

### Step 3: Add to Exporters

Add the following code to the `exporters` section:

```YAML YAML
exporters:
  otlp/middleware:
    endpoint: "your-endpoint.middleware.io:443"
    headers:
      authorization: "<your-mw-api-key>"
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      num_consumers: 100
      queue_size: 10000
```

### Step 4: Add to Service

Add the following code within the pipelines section:

```YAML YAML
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [ <your-receivers-list-for-traces> ]
      processors: [ resourcedetection, resource/middleware, 
                    <your-processor-list-for-traces> ]
      exporters: [ otlp/middleware, <your-exporters-list-for-traces> ]
    metrics:
      receivers: [ <your-receivers-list-for-metrics> ]
      processors: [ resourcedetection, resource/middleware ]
      exporters: [ otlp/middleware, <your-exporters-list-for-metrics> ]
    logs:
      receivers: [ <your-receivers-list-for-logs> ]
      processors: [ resourcedetection, resource/middleware, 
                    <your-processors-list-for-logs> ]
      exporters: [otlp/middleware, <your-exporters-list-for-logs>]
```

# Limitations

Metrics such as bandwidth and disk speed are not currently collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector and will contain `0` in those fields. This will impact the Infrastructure page as well as any custom dashboard containing these metrics.
