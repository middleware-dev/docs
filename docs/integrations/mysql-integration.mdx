title: "MySQL"
---
Collects MySQL performance and health metrics from a MySQL database.

Prerequisites
-------------
1.  Middleware Host agent should be already installed on your machine, in order to use MySQL integration.

## Setup
1. You will have to create a yaml file in your system containing database collection details, as follows:

Ex. `/home/ubuntu/mysql-creds.yaml`
```
mysql:
  endpoint: localhost:3306
  username: mysql
  password: mysql
```
<Note>You can skip the fields `username` and `password`, if your database doesn't require authentication.</Note>

<Note><strong>For Docker Agent Users</strong>: If you are running the Middleware Docker agent, then we recommend to keep the creds YAML under `/var/log` directory. This is because, the Docker agent might not support dynamic volume binding.</Note>


2. Go to Store, Enable MySQL Integration, Select a host, and set YAML path to the file created in step 1.

## Visualize Analytics
There are 2 possible ways to Visualize MySQL Analytics:

### 1. Middleware's Default MySQL Dashboard
Once you've setup the MySQL Integration, You will be able to see different Analytics in the default MySQL Dashboard.

### 2. Create your own dashboard
<p>You can create your own dashboard from scratch.</p>
<p>When you add a new widget to an existing dashboard, you'll see a list of available MySQL metrics under the "mysql" Data source.</p>
<p>These metrics can be visualized in different widget types like Timeseries, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, etc.</p>
