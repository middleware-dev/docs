Collects MongoDB performance and health metrics

Prerequisites
-------------
1.  Middleware Host agent should be already installed on your machine, in order to use MongoDB integration.

## Setup
1. You will have to create a yaml file in your system containing database collection details, as follows:

Ex. `/home/ubuntu/mongodb-creds.yaml`
```
mongodb:
    hosts:
      - endpoint: localhost:27017
    username: mongodb
    password: mongodb
```
<Note>You can skip the fields `username` and `password` if database is not password protected.</Note>

<Note><strong>For Docker Agent Users</strong>: If you are running the Middleware Docker agent, then we recommend to keep the creds YAML under `/var/log` directory. This is because, the Docker agent might not support dynamic volume binding.</Note>



2. Go to Store, Enable MongoDB Integration, Select a host, and set YAML path to the file created in step 1.

## Visualize Analytics

There are 2 possible ways to Visualize MongoDB Analytics :

### 1. Middleware's Default MongoDB Dashboard
Once you setup the MongoDB Integration, You will be able to see different Analytics in the default MongoDB Dashboard.

### 2. Create your own dashboard
<p>You can create a dashboard from scratch by yourself.</p>
<p>If you add a new widget to any existing dashboard, you will be able to see list of available MongoDB metrics under the "mongodb" Data source.</p>
<p>You can visualize in many different Widget types i.e. Timeseries, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, etc.</p>
