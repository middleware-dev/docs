<h2>Supported Machines</h2>
We have created docker distributions using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images. All the OS that supports docker should also support our docker based agent.
This is applicable on both x86 & ARM based machines, as we are using multi-platform builds.

Here is a list of Tested AWS EC2 instances.

| AWS Machines      |   Agent Compatibility   
|------             |    ---------           
|Amazon Linux       |   x86 + ARM             
|Ubuntu             |   x86 + ARM             
|Debian             |   x86 + ARM            
|Red Hat            |   x86 + ARM            

<h2>Current Technical Approach</h2>
<p>In order to collect host level details, our docker agent works on host network mode.</p>
<p>For log reading, the docker agent uses volume binding.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Current docker installation bash script works well with Linux + Mac machines. We will be making this script adaptable for Windows machines as well.</li>
</ol>
