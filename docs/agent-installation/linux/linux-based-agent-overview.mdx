|Red Hat            |   Will add support Soon (Meanwhile Refer [Docker Agent](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/docker/docker-overview)) | RPM 


<p>For Ubuntu 16.04 and older, we suggest to stick with Docker Installation</p>

<p>Please <a href="https://middleware.io/contact-us/" target="_blank"> contact us</a>, if you find more machines that works well with our agent and if you need support for any particular Architecture / OS version that is not listed above</p>

## Current Technical Approach
<p>Currently we are distributing APT packages that can be installed on the machines given above.</p>

## Roadmap

<ol>
    <li>We are planning to add support for RPM based machines.</li>
