## Overview
Middleware Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides insights into your application or website through detailed data on user interactions and frontend performance. With real-time data on page load times, errors, and more you can quickly identify and resolve performance issues to improve user experience and engagement. Check out the video below for more information.

## Prerequisites
JavaScript-based web application (mobile apps not currently supported)

## Install
This guide walks you through setting up Real User Monitoring (RUM) with JavaScript. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account.

### Step 1: Create Application Reference
Navigate to the Installation page in your Middleware Account. In the Real User Monitoring section, select `Create New Application` and provide the application name and origin(s) to whitelist. Multiple origins can be listed as a comma-separated list.

### Step 2: Import Javascript CDN
Add the following script tag to the head section of your index.html file. The tag can be copied directly from the Installation page upon completing Step 1.
```javascript HTML
<script src="https://cdnjs.middleware.io/browser/libs/0.0.1/middleware-rum.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
### Step 3: Initialize the SDK
Add the following lines in your index.html file below the script tag entered in Step 2. We recommend copying directly from the Installation page; select the appropriate Application from the list and copy the code snippet. The `window.Middleware` attribute is set in the script from Step 2. In the example below, env and recording are optional. Recording set to 1 is the default value and records the entire user session. To track only browser traces and errors set recording to 0.

```javascript JavaScript
<script>
    if (window.Middleware){
        Middleware.track({
            serviceName: "service_name",
            projectName: "project_name",
            accountKey: "account_key",
            target:"https://<UID>.middleware.io",
            env: "production",
            recording: "1"
        })
    }
</script>
```

### Step 4: Add User Information [optional]
To gather user details add key-value pairs, as shown below. Any user metadata can be defined as a key-value pair.


```javascript JavaScript
if(window.Middleware){
...
  defaultAttributes: { 
      name: 'John Doe', 
      email: 'john@email.com', 
      user_type: 'admin', // it can be key value pairs
  }
}
```

Once RUM is configured, metrics should begin appearing on the RUM Dashboard in Middleware within a few minutes. For more information on the RUM Dashboards see [here](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/rum/rum-middleware).

# Connect RUM to Tracing

RUM Tracing allows you to gain insight into the specific actions of your users. You can watch time-stamped videos of user's website interactions, pinpoint performance bottlenecks across your platform, and identify the major causes of customer drop off.

The following installation uses OpenTelemetry B3 Propagator heads. You can learn more about B3 Propagation [here](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation).

<Warning> The following APMs are supported: --------------------- </Warning>

## Install

### Step 1: Modify Middleware SDK
Add `tracePropagationTargets` to your SDK from [Step 3](#step-3-initialize-the-sdk) of the RUM Installation.

```javascript JavaScript
<script>
    if (window.Middleware){
        Middleware.track({
            serviceName: "service_name",
            projectName: "project_name",
            accountKey: "account_key",
            target:"https://<UID>.middleware.io",
            env: "production",
            recording: "1"
            tracePropagationTargets: [/localhost:3000/i, /api.domain.com/i]
        })
    }
</script>
```

### Step 2: Modify APM SDK

Navigate to your desired APM to complete your Install:

| Supported APMs| 
| :----:|
| APM 1 |
|etc |

## Accessing Session Replay

This section shows you how to access Session Replay.

### Step 1: Navigate to Trace List
Insert image (APM --> Trace List --> Session Replay)

### Step 2: Choosing a Trace
Insert image(Select trace --> access time-stamped user clickthrough)
