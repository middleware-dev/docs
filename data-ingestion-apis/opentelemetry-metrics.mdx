# Overview
We recommend using Middleware's Agent and associated SDKs to ingest data, however, more advanced users have the option to use OpenTelemetry Protocol Exporters. Each language will have a different approach which can be an adaptation from our relevant Host Agent. Instrument your OpenTelemetry code with languages that are supported by both Middleware and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/).

The example below is using javascript and an abstraction from our [node agent](https://github.com/middleware-labs/agent-apm-nodejs). All other agents can be found in our [middleware-labs repo](https://github.com/middleware-labs). If you need assistance with a specific language we are happy to work with you, however, we do not have every approach documented at this time.

# Prerequisites

1. App must already be configured to collect telemetry 

# Installation

### Step 1: Setup Resource Attributes

Middleware connects via Otel using the `mw.account_key` which can be found in the [Resource Attributes](/data-ingestion-apis/opentelemetry-metrics#resource-attributes) section. To get started, you need to set up appropriate OpenTelemetry Resource attributes, seen below:

<Note> Learn more about OpenTelemetry resources [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/resources/) </Note>

```javascript JavaScript
const resource = new Resource({
  [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: "{your-service-name}",
  ["mw_agent"]: true,
  ["mw.account_key"]: "{your-api-key}",
});
```
### Resource Attributes

| Field | Type | Required | description |
| :--: |:--:| :---: | :----:| 
| mw.account_key | string | ✅ | API key that authenticates your MW Account |
| mw_agent | boolean |✅ | True if using a host agent, false if running serverless |
| SERVICE_NAME | string | ✅ | Logical name of service, and desired filter value in Middleware | 

<Note> For more information on OpenTelemetry JavaScript Resources, head [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/resources/) </Note>


### Step 2: Configure your Exporter

Configure your exporter(s) to send data to Middleware with OTLP/HTTP or OTLP/gRPC. 

<Warning> Log ingestion is an experimental feature within Open Telemetry. Proceed with caution. </Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript OTLP/gRPC
// Install gRPC exporter libraries
const { OTLPLogExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-grpc");
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc");
const { OTLPMetricExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc");

// Place the following in your global SDK
// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC logger endpoint
const loggerExporter = new OTLPLogExporter({
  url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC metric endpoint
const metricExporter = new OTLPMetricExporter({
    url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC trace endpoint
const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

```

```javascript OTLP/HTTP
// Send HTTP POST requests to endpoints:
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/logs
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/traces
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/metrics
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Sample OTLP/HTTP Curl Request">

<Note> The following should be used as an example - we do not recommend using this specific curl request for OTLP/HTTP curl requests. Data must be in OTLP/HTTP format. Learn more [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp). </Note>
```
curl -X POST "https://demo.middleware.io/v1/metrics" \
-H "Accept: application.json" \
-H "Content-type: application.json" \
-d @ << EOF

### Step 3: Send Data to Middleware
Once you have setup your resource attributes, initialize your providers, and configure your exporters, begin sending data to Middleware.
