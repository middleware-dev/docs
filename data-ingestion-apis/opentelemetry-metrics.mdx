# Overview
We recommend using Middleware's Agent and associated SDKs to ingest data, however, more advanced users have the option to use the OpenTelemetry Protocol Exporter. Each language will have a different approach which can be an adaptation from our relevant Host Agent. Instrument your OpenTelemetry code with languages that are supported by both Middleware and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/).

The example below is using javascript and an abstraction from our [node agent](https://github.com/middleware-labs/agent-apm-nodejs). All other agents can be found in our [middleware-labs repo](https://github.com/middleware-labs). If you need assistance with a specific language we are happy to work with you, however, we do not have every approach documented at this time.

# Prerequisites

1. App must already be configured to collect telemetry 

# Installation

### Step 1: Setup Resource Attributes

Embed the Middleware Resource Attributes in your instrumentation file:

```javascript JavaScript
const resource = new Resource({
  [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: "{your-service-name}",
  ["mw_agent"]: true,
  ["mw.account_key"]: "{your-api-key}",
});
```

### Step 2: Initialize Provider (factory)

Determine which providers (e.g. log, trace, and metric factories) will export data to Middleware.

<Warning> Log ingestion is an experimental feature within Open Telemetry. Proceed with caution. </Warning>

### Step 3: Configure your Exporter

Configure your exporter(s) to send data to Middleware with OTLP/HTTP or OTLP/gRPC. 

<CodeGroup>

```javascript OTLP/HTTP
// Send HTTP POST requests to endpoints:
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/logs
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/traces
POST https://<UID>.middleware.io/v1/metrics
```

```javascript OTLP/gRPC
// Install gRPC exporter libraries
const { OTLPLogExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-grpc");
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc");
const { OTLPMetricExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc");

// Place the following in your global SDK
// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC logger endpoint
const loggerExporter = new OTLPLogExporter({
  url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC metric endpoint
const metricExporter = new OTLPMetricExporter({
    url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

// Set exporter to use Middleware gRPC trace endpoint
const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: "https://sandbox.middleware.io:443",
});

```

### Step 4: Send Data to Middleware
Once you have setup your resource attributes, initialize your providers, and configure your exporters, begin sending data to Middleware.
