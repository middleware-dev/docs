The MySQL Integration allows you to ingest and monitor the performance and health metrics of your relational database management system (RDBMS) data. This integration is useful for identifying top SQL operations by row, tallying total requests to MySQL handlers, and tracking worker thread count.

There are two different methods for setting up the MySQL Integration. [Setup #1](/integrations/mysql-integration#setup-1) assumes you are a root MySQL user whereas [Setup #2](/integrations/mysql-integration#setup-2) allows you to connect the MySQL integration as a non-root user. Both installation methods will allow you to collect the same [Metrics](/integrations/mysql-integration#metrics-collected).

# Prerequisites

Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) must be installed on your local machine. To install the MW Agent, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.middleware.io/agent-installation/overview).

# Setup #1

### Step 1: Create Database Credentials

Create a `.yaml` file containing database credentials like the below example. If the database is not password protected, the `username` and `password` fields can be removed.

`/home/ubuntu/mysql-creds.yaml`

```yaml .yaml
mysql:
    endpoint: localhost:3306
    username: mysql  
    password: mysql 

```
<Note> For Docker users, create the credentials yaml file in the `/var/log` directory. </Note>

### Step 2: Access Integrations

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installations Page in the bottom left corner, select All Integration and click MySQL

### Step 3: Enable Integration

Add a host machine from the dropdown list, input the credential path from Step 1, and Save

# Setup #2

MySQL metrics are collected by querying `performance_schema` and `sys_schema` along with status variables that are managed by `mysql-server`. To allow for this collection you must create a non-root user with specific permissions described below.

### Step 1: Create a User

Create a user named `mw` and specify your own unique password with the following command. `mw` will have the ability to login from any host unless otherwise specified.

```
mysql> CREATE USER 'mw'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
```

<Note> To specify the specific host that `mw` can log into, change your above user name to the following: `mw@'<hostaddr>'` </Note>

Check if the user was created successfully by running the following command:

```
mysql -u mw --password=<PASSWORD> -e "show status" | \
grep Uptime && echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL user - OK\033[0m" || \
echo -e "\033[0;31mCannot connect to MySQL\033[0m"
```

If successful, you will see the following output:

```
MySQL user - OK
```

### Step 2: Grant `mw` Permissions:

Grant `mw` permissions by running the following commands:

```
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'mw'@'%'
```

```
ALTER USER 'mw'@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
```

```
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'mw'@'%';
```

```
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'mw'@'%';
```

### Step 3: Check Permissions

Ensure you have properly granted permissions to the `mw` user by running the following commands:

```
mysql -u mw --password=<PASSWORD> -e "show slave status" && \
echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL grant - OK\033[0m" || \
echo -e "\033[0;31mMissing REPLICATION CLIENT grant\033[0m"
```

# Visualize Analytics

### Default MySQL Dashboard

Once the MySQL integration setup is complete, a new MySQL-specific dashboard will appear in the Dashboard Builder. This default dashboard serves as a jumping off point for visualizing and analyzing MySQL data.

### Create MySQL Widget

MySQL data can be added to dashboards as a custom widget. When adding a new widget, select the `mysql` data source to view a full list of available MySQL data.

# Alerts

Alerts can be configured for any MySQL metrics. When creating a new rule select the Database detection method and MySQL database type for available metrics to appear in the Metrics dropdown list. Select the desired metric and continue configuring the alert conditions.
