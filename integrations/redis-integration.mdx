The Redis Integration allows users to ingest and monitor the performance and health metrics of their in-memory data structure store. This integration is useful for tracking commands processed per second, tallying CPU time consumed by Redis states, and monitoring disk I/O buffers for optimal batching.

# Prerequisites

Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) must be installed on your local machine. To install the MW Agent, see our [installation guide](https://docs.middleware.io/agent-installation/overview).

# Setup

### Step 1: Create Database Credentials

Create a `.yaml` file containing database credentials like the below example. If the database is not password protected, the `username` and `password` fields can be removed.

`/home/ubuntu/redis-creds.yaml`

```yaml .yaml
redis:
    endpoint: localhost:7379
    ## all fields below are optional ##
    password: redis
    transport: tcp    ## tcp or Unix
    tls:
          - insecure: true 
          - ca_file: <path_to_certificate>
          - cert_file: <path_to_certificate>
          - key_file: <path_to_file>   
```
<Note> For Docker users, create the credentials yaml file in the `/var/log` directory. </Note>

### Step 2: Access Integrations

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installations Page in the bottom left corner, select All Integration and click Redis

### Step 3: Enable Integration

Add a host machine from the dropdown list, input the credential path from Step 1, and Save

# Visualize Analytics

### Default Redis Dashboard
Once the Redis integration setup is complete, a new Redis-specific dashboard will appear in the Dashboard Builder. This default dashboard serves as a jumping off point for visualizing and analyzing Redis data.

### Create Redis Widget

Redis data can be added to dashboards as a custom widget. When adding a new widget, select the `redis` data source to view a full list of available Redis data.

# Alerts

Alerts can be configured for any Redis metrics. When creating a new rule select the Database detection method and Redis database type for available metrics to appear in the Metrics dropdown list. Select the desired metric and continue configuring the alert conditions.

# Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Missing Integrations Menu">
  If you do not see the Integrations Menu in Middlware, that means your account has not been granted `Installation` permissions. Contact your system administrator to add the `Installation` permission to your user role in Settings.
