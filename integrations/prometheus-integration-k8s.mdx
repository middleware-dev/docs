Retrieve metrics from a Prometheus endpoint inside K8s.

## Add Middleware Prometheus Integration as a sidecar container

<Note> We are currently updating this feature. If you have any issues configuring this integration, please contast us at support[at]middleware.io </Note>

To scrape the prometheus endpoint via Middleware Agent, You will have to add this `sidecar container` in your pod:

```yaml
- name: middleware-prometheus-agent
  image: ghcr.io/middleware-labs/mw-kube-agent:prometheus-integration
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  env:
  - name: MW_TARGET
    value: https://xxxxx.middleware.io:443 # Middleware Target URL
  - name: MW_API_KEY
    value: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # Middleware API Key
  - name: PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_CONFIG
    value: job1@0.0.0.0:8889,job2@0.0.0.0:8890
```

### Understanding Environment Variables

**MW_TARGET** :
Specifies the target URL for the Middleware service. This URL defines the endpoint where your application should interact with the middleware. 

`Example Value : https://xxxxx.middleware.io:443`

**MW_API_KEY** :
Provides the API key required for authenticating with the Middleware service. Ensure the key is kept confidential and only shared with authorized users or services.

`Example Value : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_CONFIG** :
Configures Prometheus scraping targets. This variable should be set in the format 'job@address:port', where 'job' represents the scraping job name, 'address' is the IP address or hostname, and 'port' is the port to scrape metrics from.

`Example Value : job1@0.0.0.0:8889,job2@0.0.0.0:8890`

## Visualize Your Prometheus Metrics

You can now access this metrics data under our Dashboard builder
`https://app.middleware.io/reports`

1. Create a new report
2. 'Add New Widget' in the report. 
3. Select "prometheus" under the "Data Source" dropdown as shown in the screenshot below. You will be able to see a list of your metrics.

# Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Missing Integrations Menu">
  If you do not see the Integrations Menu in Middlware, that means your account has not been granted `Installation` permissions. Contact your system administrator to add the `Installation` permission to your user role in Settings.
