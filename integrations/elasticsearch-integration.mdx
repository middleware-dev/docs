# Overview

The Elasticsearch Integration allows users to track their Elasticsearch performance and health metrics from Elasticsearch clusters and nodes. Use our default dashboard to understand system-wide usage patterns and identify performance bottlenecks. Drill into all of your data within the Elastic ecosystem.

# Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="MW Host Agent">
    Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent). To install the MW Agent please see our <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview"> installation guide. </a>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Elasticsearch Installed">
    `Elasticsearch version -------------- ` or above. Check your Elasticsearch version with the following command:

    ```shell Shell
      bin/elasticsearch --version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Elastic Superuser">
    Must be an Elastic superuser as defined [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/built-in-users.html).
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Setup

<Accordion title="Step 1: Create Database Credentials">
  Create a `.yaml` file containing database credentials like the below example. If the database is not password protected, the `username` and `password` fields can be removed.

  `/home/ubuntu/elasticsearch-creds.yaml`

  ```yaml .yaml
      elasticsearch:
        endpoint: http://localhost:9200
        username: YOUR_USERNAME
        password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  ```

  <Note> If you are running the Middleware Docker Agent, keep the YAML file within the `/var/log` directory. Docker Agents might not support dynamic volume binding.</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Access Integrations">
  Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installations Page in the bottom left corner, select All Integration and click MySQL

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Enable Integration">
  Add a host machine from the dropdown list, input the credential path from Step 1, and Save
</Accordion>

# Visualize Your Data

### Default Elasticsearch Dashboard

Quickly access your Elasticsearch data with Middleware's default Elasticsearch dashboard. Navigate to the Dashboard Builder and select the Elasticsearch - Metrics (Runtime) Dashboard

<Note> Learn more about creating your own widgets and dashboards in the [Dashboard Builder](/workflow/custom-dashboard/build-custom-dashboard) section. </Note>

# Alerts

Alerts can be configured for any Elasticsearch metrics. When creating a new rule select the Database detection method and Elasticsearch database type for available metrics to appear in the Metrics dropdown list. Select the desired metric and continue configuring the alert conditions.
