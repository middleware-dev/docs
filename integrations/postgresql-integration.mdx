Collects PostgreSQL performance and health metrics

Prerequisites
-------------
1.  Middleware Host agent should be already installed on your machine, in order to use PostgreSQL integration.

## Setup
1. You will have to create a yaml file in your system containing database collection details, as follows:

Ex. `/home/ubuntu/postgres-creds.yaml`
```
postgresql:
    endpoint: localhost:5432
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
```
2. Go to Store, Enable PostgreSQL Integration, Select a host, and set YAML path to the file created in step 1.

## Visualize Analytics

There are 2 possible ways to Visualize PostgreSQL Analytics :

### 1. Middleware's Default PostgreSQL Dashboard
Once you setup the PostgreSQL Integration, You will be able to see different Analytics in the default PostgreSQL Dashboard.

### 2. Create your own dashboard
<p>You can create a dashboard from scratch by yourself.</p>
<p>If you add a new widget to any existing dashboard, you will be able to see list of available PostgreSQL metrics under the "postgres" Data source.</p>
<p>You can visualize in many different Widget types i.e. Timeseries, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, etc.</p>

The exhaustive list for PostgreSQL metrics can be seen [here](#metrics-collected)

## Alerting

You can also setup alerting for your PostgreSQL metrics from the Middleware's UI.

There is a section in alerts dedicated to "Database"
Opt for the "PostgreSQL" database and select the metrics you want to setup alerting for.
