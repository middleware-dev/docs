# Overview

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. 

With the Infrastructure Agent (Infra Agent), you can effectively monitor your ECS containers and tasks running on ECS EC2 instances and ECS Fargate in your cloud, on-prem, and hybrid architectures.

<Note> Database Integrations and the Amazon ECS Anywhere approach are not currently supported. </Note> 

# Fargate Setup

Use the Middleware and AWS Fargate integration to monitor your applications without having to manage servers.

### Create a Sidecar

For Each ECS Task that you want to monitor, add the following sidecar container in your task definition.

```json JSON
{
    "name": "mw-agent",
    "image": "ghcr.io/middleware-labs/mw-host-agent:master",
    "cpu": 256,
    "portMappings": [
        {
            "name": "8006-tcp",
            "containerPort": 8006,
            "hostPort": 8006,
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "appProtocol": "http"
        }
    ],
    "essential": true,
    "environment": [
        {
            "name": "MW_API_KEY",
            "value": "<Your Middleware API Key>"
        },
        {
            "name": "MW_TARGET",
            "value": "<Your Middleware Target Endpoint>"
        },
    ],
    "mountPoints": [],
    "volumesFrom": [],
    "logConfiguration": {
        <Setup Log Configurations as per your requirement>
    }
}
```

### Collect Metrics 

Adding the sidecar container mentioned above will automatically collect metrics data from your ECS tasks and containers. The Infra Agent uses the AWS ECS Task Metadata Endpoint to fetch metrics data.

### Collect Logs

Forward your ECS Task logs to Middleware. The `mw-agent` sidecar, mentioned [above](/integrations/aws-ecs-monitoring#create-a-sidecar), must be running before proceeeding.

        ```json JSON

                }
            }
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 2: Add a log Configuration in your main container">
    
        The Infra Agent sidecar will fetch these logs and send them to Middleware.

        ```json JSON
        "logConfiguration": {
            "logDriver": "awsfirelens",
            "options": {
                "Host": "127.0.0.1",
                "Name": "forward",
                "Port": "8006"
            }
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 3 [Optional]: Parsing JSON Structured Logs">
    
        Firelens by default sends a JSON blob which Middleware displays as the log body. Parsing the JSON logs allows the `Message` of the log being displayed while the attributes will be viewable on expansion. 
        
        To change the behavior you will need to add the below options to the `firelensConfiguration` created in Step 1.

        <Warning> the JSON structured logs generated need to have a `Message` field. Otherwise Middleware will not know what should be shown as a body of the log.</Warning>

        ```json JSON
        "firelensConfiguration": {
            "type": "fluentbit",
            "options": {
                "config-file-type": "file",
                "config-file-value": "/fluent-bit/configs/parse-json.conf",
                "enable-ecs-log-metadata": "true"
            }
        }
        ```

            1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) section
            2. In the left-hand menu, click on Task Definitions
            3. Create a new Task Definition under the JSON tab
            4. Copy and paste the configuration from your Task Definition file

    1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) section

    2. Choose the ECS cluster you will run the Infra Agent on

    3. Create a new service within the selected cluster

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


### Container Trace and Log Collection

Begin collecting container trace and log data in your EC2 instance. The Infra Agent will collect ECS container logs emitted to the `stdout` and `stderr` log stream and receive traces from your application and send to your Middleware account.

<Warning> The Infra Agent must be running as an app before setting up collection. If not, attempted trace collection will throw an error while connecting to the agent and logs will not be sent at all.</Warning>

#### Modify your Application Task Definition

You can setup container trace and log monitoring by modifying your Task Definition JSON file or following the below steps in the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title="JSON">
    1. To collect traces, configure the `environment` variable in the Task Definition
    2. To collect logs, configure the `logConfiguration` variable to enable the `fluentd` logging driver

    <Note> You do not have to collect container trace and log data at the same time </Note>


    ```json JSON
    "containerDefinitions": [
            {
            (...)
            "environment": [
                    {
            "name": "MW_AGENT_SERVICE",
            "value": "172.17.0.1"
                }
    ],
                "logConfiguration": {
                    "logDriver": "fluentd",
                    "options": {
                        "fluentd-address": "172.17.0.1:8006"
                    }
                }
            (...)
            }
        ]

    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AWS Management Console">
