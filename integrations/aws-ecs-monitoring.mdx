## ECS + Fargate setup Monitoring

For Each ECS Task that you want to monitor, add this one sidecar container in your task definition.
```
{
    "name": "mw-agent",
    "image": "ghcr.io/middleware-labs/mw-host-agent:fargate-solution",
    "cpu": 256,
    "portMappings": [
        {
            "name": "8006-tcp",
            "containerPort": 8006,
            "hostPort": 8006,
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "appProtocol": "http"
        }
    ],
    "essential": true,
    "environment": [
        {
            "name": "MW_API_KEY",
            "value": <Your Middleware API Key>
        },
        {
            "name": "MW_TARGET",
            "value": <Middleware Target Endpoint>
        },
    ],
    "mountPoints": [],
    "volumesFrom": [],
    "logConfiguration": {
        <Setup Log Configurations as per your requirement>
    }
}
```

### Metrics Collection
Adding the sidecar container as mentioned above, will automatically start collecting metrics data from your ECS tasks and containers.
Middleware Agent using AWS ECS Task Metadata Endpoint to fetch metrics data.

### Logs Collection

We offer a few different methods to forward your ECS task logs to Middleware.

#### Method 1 :  Forward ECS Task logs to Middleware

Make sure you are already running "mw-agent" sidecar mentioned at the top of this document before running the next steps.

##### Step 1: Add a fluent sidecar in your ECS task
```
{
    "name": "log_router",
    "image": "amazon/aws-for-fluent-bit:stable",
    "cpu": 0,
    "portMappings": [],
    "essential": true,
    "environment": [],
    "mountPoints": [],
    "volumesFrom": [],
    "user": "0",
    "firelensConfiguration": {
        "type": "fluentbit",
        "options": {
            "enable-ecs-log-metadata": "true"
        }
    }
}
```
##### Step 2 : Add this log Configuration in your main container

```
"logConfiguration": {
    "logDriver": "awsfirelens",
    "options": {
        "Host": "127.0.0.1",
        "Name": "forward",
        "Port": "8006"
    }
}
```
Middleware Agent sidecar will fetch these logs and will forward them to Middleware UI.

#### Method 2 : Forward ECS Task Logs from CloudWatch 
AWS ECS + Fargate based apps use "awslogs" as default logging driver. Therefore, by default these logs are available at Cloudwatch.
Adding the sidecar container as mentioned above, will automatically start collecting task logs from CloudWatch.

You will need to add 2 environment variables in order to fetch logs for only a specific task 
```
"environment": [    
    {
        "name": "MW_AWS_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME",
        "value": <Cloudwatch loggroup name>
    },
    {
        "name": "MW_AWS_ECS_TASK_REGION",
        "value": <Task Region>
    },
    
],
```

<Note>
As Middleware Agent will be running as an ECS task, it will run with `ecsTaskExecutionRole`. By default this role is not permitted to read CloudWatch logs, 
Therefore, you will have to add an inline policy to allow `ecsTaskExecutionRole` to read CloudWatch logs. Alternatively, you can create a new IAM role for this usecase and then assign this role to Middleware Agent task. 
</Note>

## ECS + EC2 setup Monitoring

You can run Middleware Agent as type `Daemon` to monitor all your ECS tasks + containers.
More Details TBA.
