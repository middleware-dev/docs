The Redpanda Integration offers effortless access to performance metrics, allowing users to visualize key insights in our dashboard. Identify bottlenecks swiftly and optimize Redpanda's performance seamlessly.

# Prerequisites

Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) must be installed on your local machine. To install the MW Agent, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.middleware.io/agent-installation/overview).

# Setup

### Step 1: Access Integrations

Login to your Middleware account, navigate to the Redpanda integration, and connect Redpanda

### Step 2: Connect Redpanda Instance

To access Redpanda metrics, choose a host to connect to your Redpanda instance

<Warning>Monitoring multiple brokers with a single host agent is not currently available.</Warning>

### Step 3: Configure Your Host

Configure your host to connect to the IP address and port that Redpanda stores its metrics

<Note> The default port for your Redpanda instance is `9664` </Note>

# Visualize Your Data

### Default Redpanda Dashboard

Quickly access your Redpanda data with Middlewareâ€™s default Redpanda dashboard. Navigate to the Dashboard Builder and select the `Redpanda - Metrics (Runtime) Dashboard`
