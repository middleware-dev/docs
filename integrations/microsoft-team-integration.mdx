The Microsoft Teams Integration allows users to configure and send custom alerts within Middleware to any public Teams channel. Collaborate directly in Teams regarding alerts that have fired in real time. 

The Microsoft Teams Integration works by directly connecting your Microsoft Teams account within Middleware. This allows Middleware to access the Microsoft Teams API and send direct messages from Middleware to the Teams channels whenever an alert is triggered.
