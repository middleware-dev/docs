The Cassandra Database Integration provides seamless access to your database performance metrics and enables users to effortlessly visualize crucial insights in a single dashboard. This integration is useful for teams that want to visualize total compaction tasks over time, read/write latency, and storage resource availability.

This integration works by pulling metrics from the database through the Middleware Host Agent. Metrics are ingested by attaching a Java Management Extension (JMX) receiver to your Cassandra cluster and sending your telemetry data to Middleware.

<Note> This integration is only supported for users with the default `AllowAllAuthenticator` authentication permissions. </Note>

# Prerequisites

Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) must be installed on your local machine. To install the MW Agent, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.middleware.io/agent-installation/overview).

# Setup

### Step 1: Access Integrations

Login to your Middleware account, navigate to the Installations page in the bottom left corner, select All Integrations and click Cassandra:

### Step 2: Connect Cassandra Instance

To access Cassandra metrics, choose a host to connect to your Cassandra Cluster:

<Note>Hosts will only show up in this list if they have a running Host Agent</Note>

### Step 3: Configure Your Host

Configure your host to connect to the IP address and JMX port of your Cassandra Cluster:

<Note> The default port for your Cassandra instance is `7199` </Note>

# Visualize Your Data

### Default Cassandra Dashboard

Quickly access your Cassandra data with Middlewareâ€™s default Cassandra dashboard. Navigate to the Dashboard Builder and select the ***Cassandra - Metrics*** Dashboard

### Create Cassandra Widgets

Create your own widget from scratch. Navigate to the Dashboard Builder and select the dashboard you would like to create a widget in. Select Add New Widget and choose the ***cassandra*** data source.

# Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Missing Integrations Menu">
  If you do not see the Integrations Menu in Middleware, that means your account has not been granted `Installation` permissions. Contact your system administrator to add the `Installation` permission to your user role in Settings.
