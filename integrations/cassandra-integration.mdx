The Cassandra Database Integration provides seamless access to performance metrics and enables users to effortlessly visualize crucial insights in a single dashboard. The integration works by pulling metrics from the database through the Middleware Host Agent.

<Note> This integration is only supported for users with the default `AllowAllAuthenticator` authentication permissions. </Note>

# Prerequisites

Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) must be installed on your local machine. To install the MW Agent, see our [installation guide](/agent-installation/overview).

# Setup

### Step 1: Access Integrations

Login to your Middleware account, navigate to the Installations page in the bottom left corner, select All Integrations and click Cassandra

### Step 2: Connect Cassandra Instance

To access Cassandra metrics, choose a host to connect to your Cassandra Cluster

<Note>Hosts will only show up in this list if they have a running Host Agent</Note>

### Step 3: Configure Your Host

Configure your host to connect to the IP address and JMX port of Cassandra Cluster

<Note> The default port for your Cassandra instance is `7199` </Note>

# Visualize Your Data

### Default Cassandra Dashboard

Quickly access your Cassandra data with Middleware’s default Cassandra dashboard. Navigate to the Dashboard Builder and select the ***Cassandra - Metrics*** Dashboard
