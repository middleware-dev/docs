## 1. Setup

    a) First you will need to select the host from which you can access your prometheus endpoint.
    b) Add Prometheus Endpoint Name and URL, which we call Job and Target in Prometheus. (You can also add multiple URLs under 1 name)
Once you save these settings. Middleware agent will start collecting metrics from the Prometheus endpoint.

## 2. Create your own dashboard
<p>You can create your custom dashboard based on prometheus endpoint we just scraped.</p>
<p>When adding a new widget to an existing dashboard, you will find a list of available Prometheus metrics under the "service" data source.</p>
<p>These metrics can be visualized using various widget types, such as Timeseries, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, and more.</p>

<Note>Data source "service" contains all the miscellaneous sources. Soon, we will be promoting "prometheus" as a data source.</Note>
