Collects MongoDB performance and health metrics

# Prerequisites

Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) must be installed on your local machine. To install the MW Agent, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.middleware.io/agent-installation/overview).

# Setup

### Step 1: Create Database Credentials

Create a `.yaml` file containing database credentials like the below example. If the database is not password protected, the `username` and `password` fields can be removed.

`/home/ubuntu/mongodb-creds.yaml`

<Note> For Docker users, create the credentials yaml file in the `/var/log` directory. </Note>

```yaml .yaml
    mongodb:
    hosts:
      - endpoint: localhost:27017
    username: mongodb
    password: mongodb
```

### Step 2: Access Integrations

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installations Page in the bottom left corner, select All Integration and click MongoDB

### Step 3: Enable Integration

Add a host machine from the dropdown list, input the credential path from Step 1, and Save

# Visualize Analytics

### Default MongoDB Dashboard

Once the MongoDB integration setup is complete, a new MongoDB-specific dashboard will appear in the Dashboard Builder. This default dashboard serves as a jumping off point for visualizing and analyzing MongoDB data.

### Create MongoDB Widget

MongoDB data can be added to dashboards as a custom widget. When adding a new widget, select the `mongodb` data source to view a full list of available MongoDB data.

The exhaustive list for MongoDB metrics can be seen [here](#metrics-collected)

# Alerts

Alerts can be configured for any MongoDB metrics. When creating a new rule select the Database detection method and MongoDB database type for available metrics to appear in the Metrics dropdown list. Select the desired metric and continue configuring the alert conditions.
