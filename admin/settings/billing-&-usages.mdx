Overview
---------
Once your trial period is over and you have more than two machines to monitor in your infrastructure, you need to upgrade to Pay-as-you-go plan. Middleware has very flexible plans. You need to pay only for what you use. See more detail in [plans and pricing](https://middleware.io/pricing/).

You can subscribe to the product as per your monitoring requirement. You can select products and click on "Update subscription" button. You will be charged at the end of the month based on the usage in your account. While subscribing to the plan, you don't need to pay anything.

You can view and update your plan details, next billing date, payment details and your billing details from Settings -> Plan & billing.
