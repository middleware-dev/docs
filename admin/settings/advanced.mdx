title: "Ingestion Controls"

The Ingestion Controls section is where users can tailor their log tracking infrastructure. Easily toggle your Middleware Agent logs, metrics, and trace ingestion on and off. The Middleware Host Agent will search for changes in your account configuration and automatically update the configuration YAML file and reload itself.

Fine-tune your log collection process by selecting your preferred hosts for tracking infrastructure file-based logs, Middleware Agent Logs, and specify custom directory paths for monitoring your log collection.

# Infrastructure File-Based Logs
Quickly enable OR disable the Middleware Agent from monitoring file-based logs for collection. Infrastructure filed-based logs are collected by default.

To disable the collection of file-based logs, navigate to Settings, select Ingestion Controls, and press the Infrastructure File-based Logs radio button.

## Middleware Agent Logs
    Quickly enable or disable Middleware Agent log collection. Middleware Agent pod-logs are generated by the Middleware Agent.

## Middleware Agent Log Paths
    
    <Note> This feature is not available in the Docker Agent since Docker does not allow dynamic volume bindings. </Note>
    
    You can dynamically select the log files you want to monitor. Add directory paths in the Middleware Agent Log Paths section.  

    Below is the accepted regex pattern:
    ```
    '^(\\/(?:[\\w_\\-^* ]+\\/)*(?:[\\w_\\-*]+(?:\\**\\/)?)?[\\w_\\-.]+[^.]$)'
    ```

    The follwing are examples of available paths:
    <Note> Asterisks (**) can represent any number of directories. </Note>
    ```
    /home/ubuntu/abc.log

    /home/ubuntu/*.log

    /home/ubuntu/**/*.log 
    ```

## Custom Attribute Controls

<Note>This feature is only available when logs are scraped from a filesystem. </Note>
With this setting, You can scrape attributes from their log body based on Regex.

You can follow the regex grouping rules mentioned here in [this document](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). 
Especially, Refer the “Grouping” section. Here is an example, How this will work.

If the log content looks like this :

`[2024-02-26 09:15:41 -0500] [671097] [ERROR] Shutting down: Master`

And if you apply the grouping regex as follows :

`\[(?P<date>.+)\] \[(?P<process_id>.+)\] \[(?P<level>.*)\] (?P<content>.+)`

<img src="/images/settings/custom-attribute-control.png" />

It will add these 4 new attributes in the existing log
```
date = 2024-02-26 09:15:41 -0500
process_id = 671097
level = ERROR
content =Shutting down: Master
```



<Note>We have a special attribute named `level`, which accepts ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG as the valid values. Based on this level attribute you will see your logs under specific severity level </Note>

# Sensitive Data Masking for Logs

With this setting, You can hide sensitive information from your log content based on Regex. 
These filters are applied during the ingestion of logs, therefore you can avoid sending sensitive information to the platform itself.

The setting will expect 2 inputs from users as shown in the image Below
1. Regex for the keywords that users want to hide
2. Replacement text. i.e. *****, HIDDEN, etc.

<img src="/images/settings/masking.png" />

Here is an example, If your log content looks like this : `Transaction ID : 675-98-3434`
Using the regex `\\d{3}-?\\d{2}-?\\d{4}` will modify the log to this : `Transaction ID : *****` before ingesting it into Middleware.

# Metrics Ingestion

By default, MW Agent metrics are automatically ingested. To disable this feature, press the radio button and click Save. Disabling metrics will limit your overall understanding of your infrastructure vitals and performance.

# Traces Ingestion

<Warning> If you disable traces, you will in turn disable all active APMs as well. </Warning>

By default, MW Agent traces are automatically ingested. To disable this feature, press the radio button and click Save. Disabling traces will limit your ability to isolate issues within your infrastructure.
