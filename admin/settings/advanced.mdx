title: "Ingestion Controls"

The Ingestion Controls section is where users can tailor their log tracking infrastructure. The Middleware Host Agent will search for changes in your account configuration and automatically update the configuration YAML file and reload itself.

Fine-tune your log collection process by selecting your preferred hosts for tracking infrastructure file-based logs, Middleware Agent Logs, and specify custom directory paths for monitoring your log collection.

<Note> This feature is not available in the Docker Agent since Docker does not allow dynamic volume bindings. </Note>

# Infrastructure File-Based Logs
Quickly enable OR disable the Middleware Agent from monitoring file-based logs for collection. Infrastructure filed-based logs are collected by default.

To disable the collection of file-based logs, navigate to Settings, select Ingestion Controls, and press the Infrastructure File-based Logs radio button.

# Middleware Agent Logs
    Quickly enable or disable Middleware Agent log collection. Middleware Agent pod-logs are generated by the Middleware Agent.

# Middleware Agent Log Paths
    You can dynamically select the log files you want to monitor. Add directory paths in the Middleware Agent Log Paths section. 

    Below is the accepted regex pattern:
    ```
    '^(\\/(?:[\\w_\\-^* ]+\\/)*(?:[\\w_\\-*]+(?:\\**\\/)?)?[\\w_\\-.]+[^.]$)'
    ```

    The follwing are examples of available paths:
    <Note> Asterisks (**) can represent any number of directories. </Note>
    ```
    /home/ubuntu/abc.log

    /home/ubuntu/*.log

    /home/ubuntu/**/*.log 
    ```
