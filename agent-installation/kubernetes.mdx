This guide walks you through installing the MW Agent in a Kubernetes environment. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in the Middleware application. 

The installation will set up a DaemonSet inside your Kubernetes cluster and add necessary components to appropriately permission the DaemonSet pods. A Kubernetes service is also created to allow components to connect to the MW Agent via Cluster IP address and ports (i.e. language-based APMs). 


# Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Kubernetes Version">
  Kubernetes `v1.21` or above
  </Step>

  <Step title="Kubernetes Access">
  Access to Kubernetes cluster and client (i.e. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/))
  </Step>

  <Step title="CLI Tools">
  Install [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [curl](https://curl.se/) and [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Install

### Step 1: Access Kubernetes Installation

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installation Page in the bottom left corner and select Kubernetes from the Infrastructure section

!["kubernetes install"](/images/agent-installation/k2.jpg)


### Step 2: Identify Kubernetes Context

Get the current Kubernetes Context and ensure the cluster belonging to this Context is where you want to install the MW Agent.

Use the following command to find out your current Kubernetes context:

```javascript Shell
kubectl config get-contexts `kubectl config current-context`
```

### Step 3: Run Kubernetes Install Command

Copy and run the installation command. An example of the command is shown below. Copying the command directly from the Installation page ensures your API key and UID are inserted accurately.

```javascript Shell
MW_API_KEY=<xxxxxxxxxx> MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/mw-kube-agent-install.sh)"
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
  
Verify the status of the MW Agent with the following command:

```javascript Shell
kubectl get daemonset/mw-kube-agent -n mw-agent-ns
```

### Step 5: Check Your Dashboard

Navigate to Middleware and ensure metrics are appearing in the <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/unified-dashboard/unified-view"> Unified Dashboard </a>. Depending on the size of your cluster, it can take up to a few minutes for metrics to appear. If metrics do not appear after this time head to our troubleshooting page for some common issues.

# Upgrade

The MW Agent is frequently updated to add new features and improve performance. More information on new features can be found in our <a href="https://newsletters.middleware.io/"> Newsletter </a>. 

To upgrade MW Agent, use the following command:

```javascript Shell
bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/mw-kube-agent-upgrade.sh)"
```

# Troubleshooting
<Warning>  Run only one MW Agent DaemonSet per cluster per host. Multiple agents will cause unexpected behavior. </Warning>

Once the MW Agent is installed on your cluster metrics should begin appearing in the Middleware application within a few minutes. If metrics do not appear, confirm that Kubernetes has access to the internet, either directly or through a proxy, and that only one MW Agent is running per cluster. 

For any issues please reach out to our team in your Slack channel or through the help menu in the Middleware Application.

### Switching Between Contexts
If you are using another thirdy-party resource for managing your Kubernetes Infrastructure (e.g. Lens) it's possible your cluster names are similar across clusters. This will make it hard to delineate between the clusters inside of Middleware.

To fix this, you can force a speicific `cluster.name` by setting the `MW_KUBE_CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable to the name(s) you are using in your thrid party resource. Once the cluster is renamed, it will automatically reset and start to catch the appropriately labeled environment variables.

# Uninstall

To uninstall the Middleware Agent use the following command:

```javascript Shell
bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/mw-kube-agent-uninstall.sh)"
```
