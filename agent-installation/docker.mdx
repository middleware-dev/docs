This guide walks you through installing the Infrastructure Agent (Infra Agent) on a machine deployed through Docker. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in the Middleware application. 

The Docker Infra Agent is a containerized version of the Infra Agent. Upon installation, the Infra Agent collects host level details from host network mode and uses volume binding for reading logs.

# Install

### Step 1: Access Docker Installation

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installation Page in the bottom left corner and select Docker from the Infrastructure section

!["Agent Installation"](/images/agent-installation/k1.png)


### Step 2: Run Docker Install Command 

Copy and run the installation command. Copy the command directly from the Installation page to ensure your API key and UID are correct 

```bash Shell
MW_API_KEY=<xxxxxxxxxx> MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/docker-install.sh)"
```

### Step 3: Add Host Tags [Optional]

Create filterable custom tags by adding the `MW_HOST_TAGS` environment variable to the installation command as comma-separated key-value pairs. Use the tag `name` to create an alias for the host (e.g. production). 

<Note> Check your host tags have been embedded by navigating to __Infrastructure__ -> __Your Desired Host__ -> __System Information__ </Note>

```bash Shell
MW_HOST_TAGS=key1:value1,key2:value2,... MW_API_KEY=...
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
    
Verify the status of the Infra Agent. If status is `UP` or `Exited`, the installation was successful. If status is blank, installation was unsiccessful. Run the following command to verify the Infra Agent status:

```bash Shell
docker ps -a --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/middleware-labs/mw-host-agent:master
```

### Step 5: Check Your Dashboard

Navigate to Middleware and ensure metrics are appearing in the <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/unified-dashboard/unified-view"> Unified Dashboard </a>. It can take up to a few minutes for metrics to appear. If metrics do not appear after this time head to our troubleshooting page for some common issues.

# Troubleshooting

<Warning>  Run only one Infra Agent per host. Multiple agents will cause unexpected behavior. </Warning>

Once the Infra Agent is installed metrics should appear in the Middleware Application within a few minutes. If metrics do not appear, confirm that the machine has access to the internet, either directly or through a proxy, and that only one Infra Agent per container is running. 

# Uninstall
To uninstall the Infra Agent use the following commands:
```bash Shell
docker stop `docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/middleware-labs/mw-host-agent:master`
docker rm `docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/middleware-labs/mw-host-agent:master`
```
