description: Linux Infra Agent - Setup & Installation Docs | Middleware
---

This guide walks you through installing the Infrastructure Agent (Infra Agent) on a Linux machine. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in the Middleware application. 

We offer two install scripts based on your operating system. Please note that not all Linux machines are supported. A list of supported machines can be found under Prerequisites.

# Prerequisites

<Steps>

  <Step title="Ubuntu">
  Ubuntu `v18.04` or above
  </Step>

  <Step title="AWS Instances">
  For AWS EC2 instances, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or Debian is required. For AWS instances using Red Hat, please install the [Docker Infra Agent](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/docker) 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Operating System">
  MacOS Linux is not supported
  </Step>

</Steps>

# Install

### Step 1: Access Linux Installation

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installation Page in the bottom left corner and select Linux-Based from the Infrastructure section

!["Agent Installation"](/images/agent-installation/k1.png)

### Step 2: Run Linux Install Command

Copy the appropriate installation command based on your machine’s operating system. Copying the command directly from the Installation page ensures your API key and UID are inserted accurately.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DEB">

    `DEB`: Compatible with Debian or Debian-based operating systems. For AWS instances this includes Ubuntu and Debian.

    ```bash Shell
    MW_API_KEY=<xxxxxxxxxx> MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/deb-install.sh)"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RPM">

    `RPM`: Compatible with Red Hat Package Manager and operating systems like Red Hat or CentOS. Use this for AWS instances using Amazon Linux. 
    
    ```bash Shell
    MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxx MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl https://install.middleware.io/scripts/rpm-install.sh)"
    ```          
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Optional Configurations

The following flags are optional modifications you can make to the MW Linux Agent. Add any of these flags to the beginning of one of the above install commands. 

<Note> For more information on configuring your MW Linux Agent, navigate to the [mw_agent](https://github.com/middleware-labs/mw-agent/blob/master/cmd/host-agent/main.go#L63) repository. </Note>

#### `MW_CONFIG_CHECK_INTERVAL`

This is a duration string to periodically check for OpenTelemetry collector configuration updates. This configuration is only useful if `MW_FETCH_ACCOUNT_OTEL_CONFIG` is set to `true`.

#### `MW_FETCH_ACCOUNT_OTEL_CONFIG`

The MW Linux Agent fetches the OpenTelemetry collector configuration from Middleware's backend. Setting `MW_FETCH_ACCOUNT_OTEL_CONFIG` to false will disable this fetching process. Users will have to provide their own OpenTelemetry collector configuration in an appropriate location (either at the default location or at the location set by `MW_OTEL_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable).

#### `MW_FLUENT_PORT`

The MW Agent has a built in Fluentd receiver. This value allows you to change the listener port for Fluentd.

#### `MW_LOGFILE`

This allows you to specify the location of your logfile that stores MW Agent logs instead of logging them to the Systemd log journal.

#### `MW_LOGFILE_SIZE`

Log file size in Megabytes to store MW Agent logs. This flag only applies if logfile flag is specified.

#### `MW_AGENT_FEATURES_INFRA_MONITORING`

Infrastructure monitoring is enabled by default in MW Agent. Setting `MW_AGENT_FEATURES_INFRA_MONITORING` to false will disable infrastructure monitoring on the host.

#### `MW_CONFIG_FILE`

This allows you to specify the location of the configuration file for MW Agent.

#### `MW_OTEL_CONFIG_FILE`

This allows you to specify the location of the OpenTelemetry collector configuration file.

#### `MW_AGENT_INTERNAL_METRICS_PORT`

This changes the location of the MW Agent internal metrics port. The default port is set to `8888`.

#### `MW_HOST_TAGS`
This allows you to create filterable custom tags as comma-separated key-value pairs. Use the tag `name` to create an alias for the host (e.g. production). 
    
<Note> Check your host tags have been embedded by navigating to __Infrastructure__ -> __Your Desired Host__ -> __System Information__ </Note>

```bash Shell
MW_HOST_TAGS=key1:value1,key2:value2,... MW_API_KEY=...
```

#### `MW_DOCKER_ENDPOINT`

This flag allows you to set the endpoint for your Docker socket if it is different from the default socket.

#### `MW_AGENT_SELF_PROFILING`

This flag is for running continuous profiling on the MW Agent itself.

#### `MW_PROFILING_SERVER_URL`

This flag allows you to specifiy the Server Address for redirecting your profiling data.


### Step 4: Verify Installation

Run the following command to verify the status of the Infra Agent:

```bash Shell
sudo systemctl status mw-agent
```

<Warning> If your Infra Agent is older than `v1.6.4`, use the below command to check the installation status. </Warning>

```bash Shell
sudo systemctl status mwservice
```
A successful installation will return the following Infra Agent Status report:

# Troubleshooting

<Warning>  Run only one Infra Agent per node per host. Multiple agents will cause unexpected behavior.</Warning>

Once the Infra Agent is installed metrics should begin appearing in the Middleware application within a few minutes. If metrics do not appear, confirm that the machine has access to the internet, either directly or through a proxy, and that only one Infra Agent is running per node. 


# Uninstall
To uninstall the MW agent, use one of the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DEB">
    ```bash Shell
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/deb-uninstall.sh)"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RPM">
    ```bash Shell
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/rpm-uninstall.sh)"
    ```  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
