---

This guide walks you through installing the Infrastructure Agent (Infra Agent) on a Linux machine. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in the Middleware application. 

We offer two install scripts based on your operating system. Please note that not all Linux machines are supported. A list of supported machines can be found under Prerequisites.

# Prerequisites

<Steps>

  <Step title="Ubuntu">
  Ubuntu `v18.04` or above
  </Step>

  <Step title="AWS Instances">
  For AWS EC2 instances, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or Debian is required. For AWS instances using Red Hat, please install the [Docker Infra Agent](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/docker) 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Operating System">
  MacOS Linux is not supported
  </Step>

</Steps>

# Install

### Step 1: Access Linux Installation

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installation Page in the bottom left corner and select Linux-Based from the Infrastructure section

### Step 2: Run Linux Install Command

Copy the appropriate installation command based on your machine’s operating system. Copying the command directly from the Installation page ensures your API key and UID are inserted accurately.

<Note> To change the MW Agent internal metrics port, use the `MW_AGENT_INTERNAL_METRICS_PORT` environment variable. The port defaults to `8888`. </Note>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DEB">

    `DEB`: Compatible with Debian or Debian-based operating systems. For AWS instances this includes Ubuntu and Debian.

    ```bash Shell
    MW_AGENT_INTERNAL_METRICS_PORT=8888 MW_API_KEY=<xxxxxxxxxx> MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/deb-install.sh)"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RPM">

    `RPM`: Compatible with Red Hat Package Manager and operating systems like Red Hat or CentOS. Use this for AWS instances using Amazon Linux. 
    
    ```bash Shell
    MW_AGENT_INTERNAL_METRICS_PORT=8888 MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxx MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl https://install.middleware.io/scripts/rpm-install.sh)"
    ```          
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Add Host Tags [Optional]

Create filterable custom tags by adding the `MW_HOST_TAGS` environment variable to the installation command as comma-separated key-value pairs. Use the tag `name` to create an alias for the host (e.g. production). 
    
<Note> Check your host tags have been embedded by navigating to __Infrastructure__ -> __Your Desired Host__ -> __System Information__ </Note>

```bash Shell
MW_HOST_TAGS=key1:value1,key2:value2,... MW_API_KEY=...
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Run the following command to verify the status of the Infra Agent:

```bash Shell
sudo systemctl status mw-agent
```

<Warning> If your Infra Agent is older than `v1.6.4`, use the below command to check the installation status. </Warning>

```bash Shell
sudo systemctl status mwservice
```
A successful installation will return the following Infra Agent Status report:

# Troubleshooting

<Warning>  Run only one Infra Agent per node per host. Multiple agents will cause unexpected behavior.</Warning>

Once the Infra Agent is installed metrics should begin appearing in the Middleware application within a few minutes. If metrics do not appear, confirm that the machine has access to the internet, either directly or through a proxy, and that only one Infra Agent is running per node. 


# Uninstall
To uninstall the MW agent, use one of the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DEB">
    ```bash Shell
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/deb-uninstall.sh)"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RPM">
    ```bash Shell
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/rpm-uninstall.sh)"
    ```  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
