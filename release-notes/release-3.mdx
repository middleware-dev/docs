# Changes

- Improvements to our trace ingestion backend allowing for large scale deployments
- Changed __Advanced__ --> __Ingestion Controls__

- Users can sort logs by both date and time

# Fixes

- Fixed an issue where parent spans would sometimes not populate
- Fixed data mismatching between APM graphs and resources
