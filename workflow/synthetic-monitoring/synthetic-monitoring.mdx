title: Synthetic Monitoring
---

Synthetic Monitoring allows you to observe your systems and application's performance using simulated requests from global locations. You can simulate network traffic and measure its performance under various constraints and conditions. Anticipate performance issues, prevent impact on end-users, and efficiently detect and troubleshoot network issues.

# Setup

<Accordion title="Step 1: Create Monitor">
    1.  Navigate to Synthetic Monitoring

    2.  Click Create Monitor

# Request Types

<Accordion title="HTTP ">
HTTP requests monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of web applications or websites. It involves simulating HTTP requests and measuring the response time, status code, and content of the response. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SSL">
SSL monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of SSL/TLS certificates used by web applications or websites. It involves simulating SSL/TLS handshakes and measuring the certificate validation time, certificate expiration, and other certificate-related metrics. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DNS">
DNS synthetic monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of DNS servers and DNS resolution for a domain name. It involves simulating DNS queries and measuring the response time and accuracy of the DNS server.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WebSocket">
WebSocket test synthetic monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of WebSocket connections used by web applications. It involves simulating WebSocket connections and measuring the response time, message delivery time, and message accuracy. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="UDP">
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) synthetic monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of UDP connections used by network applications. It involves simulating UDP packets and measuring the response time, packet loss, and other metrics.
</Accordion> 

<Accordion title="ICMP">
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) synthetic monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of network connections using ICMP packets. It involves simulating ICMP packets and measuring the response time, packet loss, and other metrics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TCP">
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) synthetic monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of TCP connections used by network applications. It involves simulating TCP connections and measuring the response time, packet loss, and other metrics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="gRPC">
gRPC synthetic monitoring is a technique used to monitor the performance and availability of gRPC connections used by network applications. It involves simulating gRPC requests and measuring the response time, error rate, and other metrics       
</Accordion>

# Public IP Addresses

Our synthetic agent is designed to test different networks and protocols of your application. If your system has restricted access to certain networks only, you will need to whitelist the following public IP addresses of our infrastructure. This will allow our synthetic agent to access your services for monitoring.

<Note> Please note that we may add, remove or change server IP addresses for security and performance reasons. We will notify you in advance of any planned changes.</Note>
