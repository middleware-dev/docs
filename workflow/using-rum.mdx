# Overview

Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides direct feedback into the user experience. We track and transmit real-time user interactions and performance metrics directly from your web pages. Learn how RUM empowers us to track user behavior, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve our digital services.

## Performance Summary

The Performance Summary provides insight into your top-level RUM performance data. This section provides information about your Core Web Vitals, total errors incurred, unique user sessions and pages visits within a certain period of time. Quickly drill into your error stack to isolate and block recurring issues.

## Session Replay

The Session Replay section provides insight into your top-level RUM Session data. From here you can drill into specific session details to easily diagnose issues and understand user behavior.

Select from the Sessions table to drill into a RUM Session. Get time stamped recordings of users' interactions. If you have set up [Trace Correllation](rum/getting-started#connect-rum-to-tracing) you will also see related backend traces.
