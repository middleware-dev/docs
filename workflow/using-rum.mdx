Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides direct feedback into the user experience. We track and transmit real-time user interactions and performance metrics directly from your web pages. Learn how RUM empowers us to track user behavior, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve our digital services.

# Session Recordings

The maximum session and session recording duration is 4 hours. If a user does not interact on the web page being recorded for more than 15 minutes, the session will timeout. Each time a user interacts with the website, an extra 15 minutes is added to the cookie's timer, ensuring the session remains active. 

A new session is created when the user interacts with the web page after the 15 minute timer expires or when the session recording time surpasses 4 hours.

Middleware masks user passwords by default. Other text can be masked using the `mw-mask` css class. Masked text will appear as `*******` in the session recording.

# Performance Summary

The Performance Summary provides insight into your top-level RUM performance data. This section provides information about your Core Web Vitals, total errors incurred, unique user sessions and pages visits within a certain period of time. Quickly drill into your error stack to isolate and block recurring issues.

# Session Replay

The Session Replay section provides insight into your top-level RUM Session data. From here you can drill into specific session details to easily diagnose issues and understand user behavior.

Select from the Sessions table to drill into a RUM Session. Get time stamped recordings of users' interactions. If you have set up [Trace Correlation](/rum/getting-started#connect-rum-to-tracing) you will also see related backend traces.

# Browser Errors
