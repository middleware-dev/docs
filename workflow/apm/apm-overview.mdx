title: Intro to APM
---

The Application Performance Monitoring (APM) section is a collection of views and dashboards that provide real-time insights into the performance of your applications. Whether instrumenting your APMs with the Infrastructure (Infra) Agent or Serverless, all of your APM data is displayed within this section of the Middleware.

# How APM Data is Collected


There are two different ways to instrument your APMs, through the [Infrastructure Agent]() or sending data directly to Middleware as a Serverless application. The Middleware Agent is an expansion of the OpenTelemetry collector, which comes with optimized compression and batching logic as well as continuous profiling support. Instrumenting the APM in a Serverless fashion results in the same user experience inside of Middleware, apart from Continuous Profiling.
