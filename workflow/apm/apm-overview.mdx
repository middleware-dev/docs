The Application Performance Monitoring (APM) dahshboard is a unified dashboard that provides real-time insights into the performance of your applications. Whether instrumenting your APMs with the Infrastructure (Infra) Agent or Serverless, all of your APM data is displayed within this section of the Middleware.

# Infra Agent vs Serverless

There are two different ways to instrument your APMs, through the [Infrastructure Agent]() or sending data directly to Middleware as a Serverless application.

The Middleware Agent is an expansion of the OpenTelemetry collector, which comes with optimized compression and batching logic as well as continuous profiling support. Instrumenting the APM in a Serverless fashion results in the same user experience inside of Middleware, apart from Continuous Profiling. 

# How APM Data is Collected

We've built a suite of supported APM packages that automatically track and export data from your services to the Infra Agent (or directly to Middleware if running as Serverless), which in turn, compresses and batches that data to Middleware.

Because our packages leverage OpenTelemetry, you are also able to customize the data sent through our APMs via any OpenTelemetry-supported methods.
