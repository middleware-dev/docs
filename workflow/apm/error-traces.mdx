Overview
--------
Middleware's APM Error List module is a powerful tool for identifying and managing errors in your application. This module provides a comprehensive list of all the errors that have been generated by the server, grouped by error group ID, and filtered using the same filters as the Trace List.

You can see the graph and list of error with option to filter.

### Error scale graph
The Error Scale Graph provides a visual representation of the number of errors generated by the server over time. This graph helps you identify any sudden spikes or dips in the error rate and take appropriate action to resolve the issue.

### Error List
The Error List provides a detailed view of all the errors that have been generated by the server. The list is grouped by error group ID and displays information such as Error Groups, Error Type, Occurrences, First Time Seen, and Last Time Seen. Using this information, you can quickly identify any recurring errors and take appropriate action to resolve them.

### Error Detail
When you click on any of these error group you will be able to see the number of error occurrences for this error group in the side panel view as below:

This panel contains detailed information about the error. This information includes the Timestamp, URL Host, URL Path, First Seen, Last Seen, Occurrences, Host, Project, and Service. The panel also includes a graph of Occurrences vs timestamps, which provides a visual representation of the error rate over time. The Error Stack displays a detailed view of the stack trace for the error. This information helps you identify the root cause of the error and take appropriate action to resolve it. The panel also includes a list of all occurrences of the error along with their attributes.
