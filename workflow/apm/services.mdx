The APM Services Dashboard displays all of your APM services in a unified dashboard. A service groups together interconnected endpoints, queries, or jobs within your application. This is useful for contextualizing broader issues within your software infrastructure. 

The dashboard landing page displays common metrics related to your APM services like requests, latency, and errors. Use the Resources, Traces, and Logs tabs to drill into your service-specific data. This dashboard is available across other APM dashboards and the log page to easily understand how data is related to other aspects of your application. 

# Resources

Resources are all of the elements utilized by your services such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. 

The Resources Table displays all of your APM services in a unified table format. This table is useful for drilling down into the traces related to the resource you are investigating to find the root cause of issues related to the service you are drilling into.

The Resources Table has the following filters:

| __Filter__                          | __Description__ |
| :---------                          | :-------------- |
| __All Operations__                  | All collected services related to your APM |
| __Most Time Consuming__             | Sorts all services by most ----- |
| __Slowest Average Response Time__   | |
| __Highest Error related__           | |
| __Throughput (calls per minute)__   | |
| __Apdex by Most Dissatisfying__     | |

# Traces

Traces traverse through multiple services within a distributed system to display interconnected spans that represent an operation or function performed by a service.

# Logs

Logs are discrete, chronological records, events, and actions that occur within your services. 


# Service Map

The Service Map displays the relationships between all of your instrumented APM services and broader infrastructure dependencies. This view can be useful for getting a conceptual grasp of your system-wide architecture and the flow of data across microservices.
