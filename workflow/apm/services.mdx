The Services page displays all of your APM data in a unified view. A service groups together interconnected endpoints, queries, or jobs within your application. This is useful for contextualizing broader issues within your software infrastructure. 

This landing page displays common metrics like requests, latency, and errors. Use the __Resources__, __Traces__, and __Logs__ tabs to drill into your data. This page is available across other APM and log pages to easily understand how data is related to other aspects of your application. Clicking on any of the charts or tables within this page will navigate you to a deeper view of that selected service, including resources, traces, and metrics.

# Resources

Resources are all of the endpoints being requested for a given service, such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. 

The Resources Table displays all of your APM services in a unified table format. Thisd table is useful for drilling down into the endpoints you are investigating to find the root cause of issues related to the services you are investigating.

The Resources Table has the following filters:

| __Filter__                          | __Description__ |
| :---------                          | :-------------- |
| __All Operations__                  | All collected services related to your APM |
| __Most Time Consuming__             | Sorts max latency descending order |
| __Slowest Average Response Time__   | Average response time presented in ascending order |
| __Highest Error Rate__              | Sorts error rate in descending order |
| __Throughput__                      | Number of requests or operations processed in calls per minute |
| __Apdex by Most Dissatisfying__     | Application Performance Index measures the responsiveness of a service in ascending order |

# Traces

Traces are the parent spans of entire requests. They are useful for providing a high level view of where most users entry points to your service begin. Drill into the traces to discover what other spans are requested in it's lifecycle.

# Logs

All logs collected by the specific service within the selected timeframe will be displayed here. It is a simplified view of the [Log Explorer]().

# Service Map

The Service Map displays the relationships between all of your instrumented APM services and broader infrastructure dependencies. This view can be useful for getting a conceptual grasp of your system-wide architecture and the flow of data across microservices.
