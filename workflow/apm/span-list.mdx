The APM Span List Dashboard displays all collected spans across your instrumented APMs in a centralized dashboard. This page provides you detailed visibility into the execution flow of individual operations within a transaction or request.

<Note> For more information on drilling into your spans, navigate to [Drilling Into Your Data](). </Note>

# Service List

The Service List displays all of your services in a single table, functioning as the jumping off point for drilling into your spans. This list is useful for broadly traversing across parent and child spans separately before drilling into the exact span you are interested in.
