The Span List page displays all collected spans across your instrumented APMs in a unified view. This page provides you with detailed visibility into the execution flow of individual operations within a transaction or request.

<Note> For more information on drilling into your spans, navigate to [Drilling Into Your Data](). </Note>

# Service List

The Service List displays all of your services in a single table, functioning as the jumping off point for drilling into your spans. This list is useful for broadly traversing across parent and child spans separately before drilling into the exact span you are interested in.

# Drilling Into Spans

Start your drill down by selecting a span from the Service List to access detailed information about that span's trace attributes, events, and error traces. This is useful for troubleshooting low-level performance issues, detecting sudden spikes in span durations, and changes in service dependencies.

Use the Flame Graph to identify parent spans with the largest execution time across your application. Use the Span List to delineate the hierarchical structure of your spans, their relationship with their parent spans, and interactions with other relevant services.
