title: Drilling Into Your Data
---

The Drill Down feature enhances your ability to investigate, analyze, and resolve issues without needing to switch contexts. Instead of sifting through large volumes of data indiscriminately, focus your efforts on drilling into relevant and focused subsets of data in order to save your team time and effort.

This feature is available across all of Middleware and works by passing the context of your data from everything to everything. Clicking on any of Middleware's interactive tables will produce popouts that divulge the interconnectedness of your system infrastructure in a single window.

# Events

Events are specific occurrences that transpire at a particular moment in time like an uncaught exception, user logout, and threshold breaches. 

# Spans

Spans are structured log messages that represent a single operation in a trace. They allow you to break down your traces into discrete operations. Multiple connected spans form a trace, with a single root span that describes the entire operation. Spans are useful for identifying system performance bottlenecks and dependencies across your infrastructure in a concise, structured, and human-readable format.

# Traces

Traces are the entire path of a transaction or request as they flow through various components of your distributed system. Traces are particularly useful for identifying the root cause of a seemingly isolated issue in a broader context, such as latency cascading and dependency failures. 

Distributed Traces look at entire operations and how they form transactions. Distributed Traces are composed of spans, with a start and end time and location where they occur.

### Trace Attributes

Trace Attributes are key-values pairs that contain metadata associated with the span you are investigating.

### Error Traces

Error traces are records of the sequence of function calls and their associated parameters and variables that occur when an error or exception occurs in your software application. They are useful for correlating other types of data collected by your observability product, such as performance metrics, log messages or system events. 

### Access Traces from Logs

# Logs

Logs are timestamped records of text that contain information about events, activities, and messages generated by your distributed software architecture. Logs contain metadata that can be structured or unstructured. Logs are at the core of most drill down practices and are useful when drilling into resolving event-based issues, post-mortem analysis related to outages, and monitoring complex systems patterns and potentially abnormal behavior.
