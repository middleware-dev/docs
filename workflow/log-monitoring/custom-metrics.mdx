The Custom Metrics section allows you to create filters that graphically display your log data. This feature is useful for transforming your raw data into a digestible format and drilling directly into the Log Explorer

Custom Metrics are generated from your log data. An [OpenTelemetry Connector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#connectors) consumes the logs as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline.

# Create Custom Metric

To create a Custom Metric, select an attribute for your initial query, determine how your query will be recorded in the count/measure field, add another aggregation method to filter your initial query, and provide your custom metric a descriptive, easily searchable name.
