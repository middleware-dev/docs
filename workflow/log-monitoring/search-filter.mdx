The Search and Filter features within the Logs page provide a streamlined method for accessing your data. Create persistent filters to preserve your customized views, efficiently browse through your logs, and access important collections of logs in a single button click.

Middleware parses out all JSON keys from your logs as attributes, which in turn make up the filter list on the left. Any key found in your logs will appear in the leftmost list in alphabetical order, with the exception of SeverityText which is always at the top

# Save Filter Combinations

Saving your filter combinations allows you to easily access data without redundantly searching through irrelevant logs. This feature increases the speed by which you can identify the exact logs you are are looking for.

### Build Your Custom Filter

Create your initial filter from the Query Logs search bar at the top of the Logs page:

### Save & View Your Filter
