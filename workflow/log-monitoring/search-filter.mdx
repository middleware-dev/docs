The Search and Filter features within the Logs page provide a streamlined method for accessing your data. Create persistent filters to preserve your customized views, efficiently browse through your logs, and access important collections of logs in a single button click.

To quickly filter your log data, use the leftmost column on the logs page to toggle on and off filters sorted by __Levels__, __Additional__, __NameSpace__, __APM Projects__, and __Sources__.

# Create New Filters

Filters allow you to easily access data without redundantly filtering through irrelevant logs. Create a custom filter that you have access to with a single click.

### Build Your Custom Filter

Create your initial filter from the Query Logs search bar at the top of the Logs page:
