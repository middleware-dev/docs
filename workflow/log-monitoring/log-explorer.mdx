The Log Explorer is where all of your historical log data is located, including the date and time the log was fired as well as its corresponding resource attributes. This section is useful for accessing raw log resource attributes, drilling into a single host's metrics and processes, and tracing requests across your distributed microservices.

To begin drilling down into a log, select the Date value that corresponds to your log of interest or use the advanced [Filter and Search]() feature to access your data.

# Log Properties

The Log Properties section displays a componentized version of your raw JSON object:

# Metrics

Within the Metrics section, there are three separate tabs relating to __Host__, __Process__, and __Container__ data.

### Host

The Host section displays all of your host data in relation to the log you have drilled into. This tab is useful for identifying usage, network connection, and memory usage by state, and disk input/output on a per-host basis.
