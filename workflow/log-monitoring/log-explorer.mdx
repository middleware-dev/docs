The Log Explorer is where all of your historical log data is located, including the date and time the log was fired as well as its corresponding resource attributes. This section is useful for understanding logs at a deeper level. By drilling into a log you'll be able to see raw log resource attributes, the associated host's metrics and processes, and any traces related to the log.

To begin drilling down into a log, select the Date value that corresponds to your log of interest or use the advanced [Search & Filter](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/search-filter) feature to access your data.

<Note> For more information on drilling into your logs, navigate to [Drilling Into Your Data](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/drilling). </Note>

# Log Properties

The Log Properties section displays a componentized version of your raw JSON object:

# Raw

The Raw section displays the JSON object for the specific log entry you are drilling into:

# Metrics

Within the Metrics section, there are three separate tabs relating to __Host__, __Process__, and __Container__ data.

### Host

The Host section displays all of your host data about the host the log came from. This tab is useful for identifying usage, network connection, and memory usage by state, and disk input/output on a per-host basis.

### Process

The Process section displays all the processes related to the host the log came from. This tab is useful for identifying CPU, physical, and virtual memory usage on a per-process basis.

### Container

The Container section displays all of your container data about the host the log came from. This tab is useful for identifying received and transmitted network packets as well as CPU usage on a per-container basis.

# Source Logs

The Source Logs section displays all of your unprocessed records generated by the underlying components of your infrastructure:

# Traces

The Traces section displays all of your trace data related to the log you are drilling into. Logs contain an attribute called the trace ID, which correlates trace data to that specific log. Correlating logs with traces is useful for contextualizing larger system-wide issues within your infrastructure.

Use the Flame Graph or Span View to understand the flow of trace requests through your system, the distribution of stack errors, and call hierarchies. The __View Service__ and __View Trace__ features (listed below) allow you to drill even further into your logs by contextualizing broader infrastructure issues.

<Note> To access the Flame Graph and Span View, you must first setup your [APM](https://docs.middleware.io/apm-configuration/apm_overview) and instrument [RUM](https://docs.middleware.io/rum/rum-overview). </Note>

### View Service

The View Service button takes you directly to the APM Page containing a list of connected services relative to the original log you were drilling into:

### View Session

The View Session button gives you the ability to view the [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://docs.middleware.io/rum/rum-overview) session connected to your log:
