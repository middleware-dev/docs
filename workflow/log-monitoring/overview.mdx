The Log Monitoring page helps you visualize logs across multiple sources such as your server, container, cloud environment, and application. This page functions as a centralized interface for drilling into your logs and provides an easy way to correlate events across different components in your architecture.

# How Log Collection Works

Logs are collected through the [Infrastructure Agent]() and sent to Middleware's backend log capture service. The Infra Agent reads logs from the local file system and transfers them to our internal services which process and index them to be analyzed later.

# Log Data Format

Logs are received by Middleware in OpenTelemetry format. OpenTelemetry logs can be represented in multiple configurations, allowing you to unambiguously map to other log formats (like Fluentd).

# Alternate Log Collection Methods

You are still capable of sending your log data without the Infra Agent, however, you run the risk of losing logs due to outages or transient network errors and slower buffering times during the batching process.

<Note> Middleware supports the Fluentd open-source data collector and Fluentbit agent for transmitting data to Middleware.</Note>
