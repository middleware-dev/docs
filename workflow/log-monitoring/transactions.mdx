Transactions traverse across your system and aggregate your log data with other data that exists outside of the log you are already filtering. This feature is useful when you need to identify broader patterns within your infrastructure that are related to the log you are actively filtered. Examples of transactions range from actions within a mobile app, function calls, and CPU instructions.

Transactions are most commonly represented as traces that propogate from one part of your system to another in the form of a request. Transactions are merely conjoined traces.

# Transaction Measures

Measures are additional ways for you to filter your data:

| __Measure__          | __Description__ |
| :----------          | :-------------- |
| __Count__            | Tracks the total number of times the aggregated metric has been fired |
| __Max__              | Displays the maximum value of the aggregated metric |
| __Most Frequent__    | Identifies the most frequent value of the aggregated metric |
| __Where__            | Adds additional aggregation layer to query |         
| __Contains__         | Filters log entry based on whether the specified field contains a particular string or subpattern |
| __Does Not Contain__ | Filters log entry based on whether the specified field __does not__ contains a particular string or subpattern |
| __Greater Than__     | Aggregates metrics that are greater than a specified threshold or reference point |
| __Smaller Than__     | Aggregates metrics that are less than a specified threshold or reference point |

# Create a Transaction

# Transaction Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Container Name">
    `container_name` is aggregated across all logs and then a secondary aggregation is performed specifically on containers with names that contain the subpattern or string `kafka`
