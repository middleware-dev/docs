# Transactions

Transactions allow you to aggregate your log data with other data that exists outside of the log you are already filtered into. This feature is useful when you need to identify broader patterns within your infrastructure that are related to the log you are actively filtered.

<Note> For more information on creating Transactions, navigate to [Log Monitoring - Common Practices](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/log-monitoring/log-monitoring-common-practices#create-a-transaction). </Note>

### Transaction Measures

Measures are additional ways for you to filter your data:

| __Measure__       | __Description__ |
| :----------       | :-------------- |
| __Count__         | |
| __Max__           | |
| __Most Frequent__ | |
| __Where__         | |         

# Create a Transaction

Navigate to the logs page and select the Transactions tab.
