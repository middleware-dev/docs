title: Transforming Logs into Transactions
sidebarTitle: Transactions
---

Transactions provide you the ability to run aggregations on top of your logs across all other collected attributes within Middleware. This is useful for building a transactional view of your logs, selecting specific attributes to group by, and identifying broader patterns related to the log you are actively filtering. 

Transactions work by compiling logs based on occurrences in a series of actions, like a user's session or a request handled across your microservice architecture. Examples of transactions range from actions within a mobile app, to function calls and CPU instructions.

# Transaction Measures

Measures allow you to add aggregations across your chosen grouping attribute:

| __Measure__          | __Description__ |
| :----------          | :-------------- |
| __Count__            | Tracks the total number of times the aggregated metric has been fired |
| __Max__              | Displays the maximum value of the aggregated metric |
| __Most Frequent__    | Identifies the most frequent value of the aggregated metric |
| __Where__            | Adds additional aggregation layer to query |         
| __Contains__         | Filters log entry based on whether the specified field contains a particular string or subpattern |
| __Does Not Contain__ | Filters log entry based on whether the specified field __does not__ contains a particular string or subpattern |
| __Greater Than__     | Aggregates metrics that are greater than a specified threshold or reference point |
| __Smaller Than__     | Aggregates metrics that are less than a specified threshold or reference point |

# Create a Transaction

Navigate to the logs page, select the Transactions tab, choose your desired aggregation metric, and add one or multiple measures to better understand your logs.

# Transaction Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Container Name">
    Aggregates the `container_name` across all logs and then a secondary aggregation is performed specifically on containers with names that contain the subpattern or string `kafka`

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Error Messages">
    Isolates the most frequent `error.message` across all projects using the `project.name` metric.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="RUM Browser Trace">
    Aggregates all logs by their `id` when a RUM session occurrs by selecting the `browser.trace` metrics contains the value `true`.
