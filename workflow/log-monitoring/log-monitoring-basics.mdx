title: Log Monitoring Basics
---

The Log Monitoring page helps you visualize logs across multiple sources such as your server, container, cloud environment, and application. You can easily collect, process, explore, and monitor logs with Middleware in real time.

# How Logs Work

This page provides an easy way to correlate events across different components and track the flow of requests through your systems architecture. 

# Logs List

The Logs List is where all of your historical log data is located, including the date and time the log was fired as well as its corresponding resource attributes. 

Drill into a given log by selecting the Date value to access log properties, raw JSON data, metrics associated with that log, Source Logs, and Traces.

### Log Properties

The Log Properties section displays a componentized version of your raw JSON object:

### Raw

The Raw section displays the JSON object for the specific log entry you are drilling into:

### Metrics

Within the Metrics section, there are three separate tabs relating to __Host__, __Process__, and __Container-specific__ data.

#### Host

The Host section displays all of your host data in relation to the log you have drilled into. This tab is useful for identifying usage, network connection and memory usage by state, and disk input/output on a per host basis.

#### Process

The Process section displays all the processes related to the log you have drilled into. This tab is useful for identifying CPU, physical, and virtual memory usage on a per process basis.

#### Container

The Container section displays all of your container data in relation to the log you have drilled into. This tab is useful for identifying received and transmitted network packets as well as CPU usage on a per container basis.

### Source Logs

The Source Logs section displays all of your unprocessed records generated by the underlying components of your infrastructure:

### Traces

The Traces section displays all of your trace data related to the log you are drilling into:

#### Flame Graph 

#### Spans

#### Trace attributes

#### Events

#### Logs

#### Error Traces

#### Session Replay


# Transactions

Transactions allow you to aggregate your log data with other data that exists outside of the log you are drilling into. This feature is useful when you need to identify broader patterns within your infrastructure that are related to the log you are actively drilling into.

### Create a Transaction 

# Custom Metrics

Custom Metrics allow you to create custom filters that index specific aspects of your log data
