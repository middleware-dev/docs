title: Dashboard Basics
---

The Dashboard Builder allows you to generate new dashboards in under a minute, integrate custom widgets into existing dashboards, or effortlessly clone default dashboards for further refinement. Drill into any data ingested into Middleware with advanced filtering options by date range, metric value, or any metric attribute.

# How Dashboards Work

The Dashboard Builder is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based approach that enables users to create complex query logic without the added stress of learning a new query language. The metrics made available to users when constructing dashboards are dynamically generated based on the data that users ingest into Middleware. 

For example, if you have instrumented Middleware's Infrastructure Agent and APM packages, you will have access to all of your host and application-level data. 

<Note> For more information on instrumenting the Infra Agent and APM packages, navigate to the [Quickstart](https://docs.middleware.io/getting-started) page.</Note>

# Create New Dashboard

To get started, navigate to the Dashboard Builder page, select __Create Dashboard__, label your new dashboard and press __Save Changes__:

You have the option to create a dashboard from an existing data source or create a widget for an existing dashboard. The following describes how to create a dashboard from an existing data source. For more information on creating a widget, navigate to the [Create New Widget](/workflow/custom-dashboard/dashboard-builder-overview#create-new-widget) section.

Create a new dashboard by selecting a data source to start your dashboard with:

### Chart Types

Choose from one of the following types of charts for your widget:

| __Chart Type__     | __Use Case__ |
| :-------------     | :------------|
| __Timeseries__     | Describes trends that are collected and ordered with respect to time  |
| __Bar__            | Helpful for visually comparing differences categorical data and groups |
| __List__           | Ideal for comparing numerical data in combination with multiple attributes |
| __Query Value__    | Helpful when you need to always know the status/value of a single metric|
| __Pie Chart__      | Organizes and shows data as a percentage of a whole |
| __Scatter Plot__   | Ideal for comparing the relationship/correlation between two metrics |
| __Tree Plot__      | Displays hierarchal relationship of your data as a function of size and color |
| __Top List Chart__ | Used for identifying top elements given a metric and set grouping |
| __Heatmap Chart__  | Helps you identify the range of values that your data resides in with respect to time |
| __Hexagon Chart__  | Ideal for identifying which host and containers are running in your environment |

### Create Your Query

Create your query logic in the Metrics Section. Select the specific metric you would like to query, aggregate, and filter. Specify the interval at which data is ingested, create metric aliases to easily interpret what is displayed within the widget, and filter out unwanted data within your query.

For certain aggregation types, Average, Sum, Min and Max, there is a concept of an __Aggregate By__. To understand how __Group By__ and __Aggregate By__ work together, think of your queries like 2-dimensional arrays, where __Aggregate By__ is a function that performs a transformation on each subarray and __Group By__ performs an aggregate function on the aggregate outputs across all arrays. 

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/eG3u_V8DXIZhmBLur9Qg9qY31B1haqjWpzkChFCxjXFYoxNrj9IClgAuuMRNz4kBFkgY5mUbVz8ERI7Gqq4-tkqOhlZhGpBkVuTRGLQdjeN4v4mToXoY-E8K0f78O2ttt3xu_2tvyvFsNU0ExFjc9Ik)

#### Group By

The Group By field is the outer most aggregation made in your query. Each metric is allowed to have one __Group By__, and each individual metric in a single widget can have different __Group Bys__. 

You can group your metrics by any resource attributes or metric attribute that Middleware has collected.

The below example tracks CPU utilization by host; it is grouping the `system.cpu.utilization` metric by all unique instances of the `host.name` metric:


![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ecBBt0x3KYh_2QyUksFy16HIKqlpl3k4PUyxIDjgrHD6M1iNkOiS8iR0P7vkHqktOCj8IdhZf-N8o6falplfl8KtNlHE4mFZFr65O_4ibg0OjXrxR3lL5zSPzLhKWppc_2YzQ6T_6ukb8VXkdA4EaYU)

When you first create a Widget the field will be set to `Group By`. The following table displays all available options for the `Group By` field:

| __Aggregation Type__ | __Description__                                                |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| __Average By__       | Average of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Sum By__           | Sum of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Minimum By__       | Minimum of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Maximum By__       | Maximum of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Any By__           | Gathers all possible values in selected time range for given metric __and/or__ attribute |
| __Unique By__        | Count of unique values in selected time range for given metric __and/or__ attribute |
| __Count By__         | Count of all values in selected time range for given metric __and/or__ attribute |
| __Aggregated By__    | Groups all values in selected timerange for given metric __and/or__ attribute |

#### Aggregate By

The Aggregate By field is a nested aggregation technique that allows you to aggregate your initial query, the inner layer of data. 

The below example is grouping the `container.memory.percent` metric by averaging the values of the `container.name` attributes and summing `container.memory.percent`:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ohE5zbuYTvxfE_A3tAdR-ccxs11a_Z8XBPEmcDOLn4-jEe7pFGIwtOQDPkm4OwTH6h1-hmEUGZpFltgzQ1i2CwOn8gugkjRmIC4GM_YcFqGmnrCh1PBtHlFteYKpwiDSXCz_EZMfckZp-wbqhV-pWx4)

#### Filters

The filter feature is used to remove unwanted metrics within your query. The list of available filters is pulled from each metric's attributes, and the values are based on the data pulled for that attribute in that timerange. 

The below example is filtering out any `host.id` containing `ip-172-31-13-218.us-east-2.compute.internal`:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_50CgdVxjgsqeqS6U3S8Rud9llopVXSi97d2WXCo4shRYJp79HjUs8gGTq_ZLihDDlP4wpi3IqCvaT6z4NpnhXAQWzhNWbe2uUS89Gw4Nd8ww_RX95Ce5p4LsR_SBO3-0LSp3sAht3heL01QDKgCAQQ)

The following table displays all available filter functions:

| __Filter__                    | __Description__                                                |
| :-------------------          | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `!=`                          | Not Equal to |
| `=`                           | Equal to |
| `IN`                          | Checks if value is `IN` collection of filter values |
| `NOT IN`                      | Checks if value is __not__ `IN` collection of filter values |
| `LIKE`                        | Checks if value __and__ similar values in collection of filter values |
| `NOT LIKE`                    | Checks if value __and__ similar values __not__ in collection of filter values |
| `ILIKE (case insensitive)`    | Same as `LIKE` but case insensitive|
| `NOT ILIKE (case insensitive)`| Same as `NOT LIKE` but case insensitive |
| `IS NULL`                     | Checks if value in collection of filter values `IS NULL` |
| `IS NOT NULL`                 | Checks if value in collection of filter values `IS NOT NULL` |

#### Alias

The Alias feature allows you to overwrite the metric name displayed in your widget for increased readability:

### Advanced

#### Time Aggregation

Users are able to define the interval at which data is aggregated. By default Middleware aggregates over 15 second windows. This is most useful when sending custom metrics at a non-default rate (e.g. every 1 minute).

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uVnCPQxM-l5Mo8Ys4yxFkEBznmgekLXHFqG3eBId8mNyxkVD0ukzhkZ2sjcJPqhEw_qbvVqly2zRhBHvmsbtf5JwqbRE_HMv8-NC-OqmlHpm5sWyxy89P6vBz0ZTepz1ooQp2a1dglR919jE6Ml8KJQ)

#### Unit Format

The Unit Format dictates how the metric is displayed on the frontend. This will impact the values you see on the y-axis as well as in the hover over tooltip.

The following table displays all available Unit Formats:

| __Data Representation__   | __Description__                                                |
| :-------------------      | :------------------------------------------------------------  |
| __Default__               | The default unit format that metric is collected in |
| __Percentage__            | Displays metric as a percentage of the whole (meant for proportion, rates, and relative quantities) rounded to two decimal places |
| __Date Format__           | Displays the `timestamp` at which the query was fired (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)|
| __Time Ago__              | Displays the amount of time passed since the last `timestamp` value was ingested (in `hour-min-sec` format) |
| __Bytes to Size__         | Displays metric in bytes (autoscaling to `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`...`YB`) |
| __Byte Rate__             | Displays metrics in bytes per second (autoscaling to `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`...`YB`) |
| __Time Utilization__      | Displays total amount of time metric is in use |
| __Count__                 | Displays number of times a metric has been queried over time |
| __Age__                   | Displays the age of the `timestamp` value |

### Display Preferences

The Display Preferences section is where more granular display options will be available. For now, the only option is to select the timerange for the widget. 

__Global Time__ is the default value and tells the widget to listen to the global time range selector. Any other time range selected, e.g. 1 minute, will force the widget to ignore the global filter.

### Name Your Widget

The Widget Title is the title that will be displayed at the top of your widget on the dashboard. 

# Clone Dashboards & Widgets

The clone feature allows you to experiment with new or slightly modified dashboard designs without disrupting your existing setup. Save time by cloning widgets instead of recreating them from scratch. 

To clone a widget, click on the ellipses in the top right corner of the widget and select `clone`:
