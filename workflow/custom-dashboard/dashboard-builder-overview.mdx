The Dashboard Builder allows you to generate new dashboards in undere a minute, integrate custom widgets into existing dashboards, or effortlessly clone default dashboards for further refinement. Drill into any data that you port to Middleware with advanced filtering options by date range and metric value.

# How Dashboards Work

The Dashboard Builder is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based approach that enables users to create complex query logic without the added stress of learning a new query language. The metrics made available to users when constructing dashboards are dynamically generated based on the data that users port to Middleware. 

# Create New Dashboard

Create a new dashboard by selecting a data source to start your dashboard with:

Select the metrics you would like to include as widgets in your dashboard:

Once you have added widgets to your dashboard, you will be taken directly to your dashboard:

# Create New Widget

Navigate to the dashboard you would like to add a new widget to and select __Add Widget__ and __Create Widget__:

### Step 1: Select Chart Type

Choose from one of the following types of charts for your widget:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/LyMx_1CWIjqGEdzQYF_0XveQ3v-NvYJHLFA3N64iQfmfIx7KisKS0v2zx2VdMlB2caX9bAhYJUA9VULXsE8zGZHNH6XiBYbi0tjhlYTx8Uv5uBVKi80uDlceM9TUIGlZATlxwD6Pa1mJywRFU3XOYUQ)

### Step 2: Create Query

Create your query logic in the Metrics Section. Select the specific metric you would like to query, aggregate, and filter. Specify the interval at which data is ingested, create metric aliases to easily interpret what is displayed within the widget, and filter out unwanted data within the query.

#### Group By

The Group By field is the outer most aggregation made in your query. The way in which you aggregate a metric is contingent on the initial metric you have selected for your widget. Group your initial metric with resource attributes, metric attributes, or another metric based on the selected metric. The below example is grouping the `container.name` metric by all unique instances of the `container.name` metric:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lJ_3zm4C37Zgv8oWBRza4Z9-BbdJdlXD-lxbFq2qfGD579JQ9tNR_1MbC0zLLLW9ufQ-MQQa1_nwD4tg5PG-9QTpCDdsX5rE4UDIN-y9sILxyPlCHF8C8FcYv1od9VqK2ZACHS1NBAQFDk6yuOLgRzM)

The following table displays all available methods for aggregating your chosen metrics:

| __Aggregation Type__ | __Description__                                                |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| __Average By__       | Average of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Sum By__           | Sum of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Minimum By__       | Minimum of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Maximum By__       | Maximum of all values in selected time range for given metric |
| __Any By__           | Gathers all possible values in selected time range for given metric __and/or__ attribute |
| __Unique By__        | Count of unique values in selected time range for given metric __and/or__ attribute |
| __Count By__         | Count of all values in selected time range for given metric __and/or__ attribute |
| __Group By__         | Groups all values in selected timerange for given metric __and/or__ attribute |

#### Inner Value Aggregation

The Inner Value Aggregation is a nested aggregation technique that allows you to aggregate your initial query. The below example is grouping the `k8s.node.memory.usage` metric by summing the `k8s.cluster.name` attributes together and aggregating __Any__ `k8s.node.memory.usage`:

#### Filter

The filter feature is used to remove unwanted metrics within your query. The below example is filtering out any `host.id` containing `ip-172-31-13-218.us-east-2.compute.internal`:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_50CgdVxjgsqeqS6U3S8Rud9llopVXSi97d2WXCo4shRYJp79HjUs8gGTq_ZLihDDlP4wpi3IqCvaT6z4NpnhXAQWzhNWbe2uUS89Gw4Nd8ww_RX95Ce5p4LsR_SBO3-0LSp3sAht3heL01QDKgCAQQ)

#### Advanced

The Advanced section allows you to specify the interval at which your data is ingested and displayed at.

<Note> The default Data Aggregation Interval is assumed to be every 15 seconds unless specified. </Note>

#### Alias

The Alias feature allows you to overwrite the metric name displayed in your widget for increased readability:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8gAYYTNk5B9dH_6a6S6DLq-zItBxQU_pv0GBuM0PnOonqY9kbxMiESmKRNa_vG6R7vDrhl5ELX_nRGloIlsHm5VDBM1xRuUuO7Az8wZk3orJnG6yrvTGeA8Nul_XDGugYy4_NnEavJISDxFtMdcMVyw)

### Step 3: Set Display Preferences

The Display Preferences section is the default time range that is displayed when you open the dashboard.

<Note> Although this is the default time range, drill into other time ranges with the Date Range filter. </Note>

### Step 4: Enter Widget Title

The Widget Title is the title that will be displayed at the top of your widget on the dashboard.

# Clone Dashboards & Widgets

The clone feature allows you to experiment with new or slightly modified dashboard designs without disrupting your existing setup. Save time by cloning widgets instead of recreating them from scratch. 

To clone a widget, click on the elipses in the top right corner of the widget and select `clone`:

To clone a dashboard, click on the elipses located in the dashboards table under `Actions` and select `clone`:
