### CPU Utilization Alert

The following alert tracks the average CPU Utilization for a Kubernetes node. This alert is monitoring a single Kubernetes node, specified by the Filter configuration. A Critical alert is fired every time the average CPU Utilization of the specified Kubernetes node exceeds 5 CPUs at a time. This is checked on a 5 minute interval.
