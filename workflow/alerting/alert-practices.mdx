The following guide describes best practices for configuring, maintaining, and managing essential alerts. Let this be the starting point to ensure you are effectively monitoring your system-wide infrastructure.

# Resource Monitoring Alerts

### CPU Utilization Alert

The following alert tracks the average CPU Utilization for a Kubernetes node. This alert is monitoring a single Kubernetes node, specified by the Filter configuration. A Critical alert is fired every time the average CPU Utilization of the specified Kubernetes node exceeds 5 CPUs at a time. This is checked on a 5 minute interval.

### Memory Consumption Alert

The following alert tracks the average amount of memory used when data is being read and written across your entire system. A Warning is fired when `system.memory.usage` is greater than 50 bytes and a Critical warning when it is greater than 75 bytes.

<Note> The __State__ filter is left blank so that all state metrics (e.g. buffered, cached, free, etc.) are collected.</Note>

### APM Monitoring Alert

The following alert tracks the total number of trace requests from a single APM. This alert uses the `IN` operator to monitor a specific `service.name` with the Filter configuration. A Critical message is fired when the total number of trace requests exceeds 5,000 in a 10 minute period.
