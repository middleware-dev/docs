The Alerts page is a tool for proactively monitoring and responding to critical events across your entire infrastructure, notifying you of any deviations or anomalies. Configure and manage your alerts to ensure your team is aware of system-wide issues.


# Create an Alert

### Step 1: Create Rule

Navigate to the Alerts section and select __Create Rule__.

### Step 2: Configure Rule

#### Step 2a: Select Your Data Source

A Data Source is the fundamental data that your Alert is created around. 

#### Step 2b: Add Metrics

Metrics are parts of the Data Source that you are interested in monitoring. 

#### Step 2c: Set Filters

The Filters section allows you to consolidate the data that you have collected in the Metrics section.

<Note> Corresponding letters in the __Metrics__ and __Filters__ section indicate a relationship (e.g. __Metric A__ is filtered by __Filter A__).</Note>

#### Step 2d: Create Triggers

A trigger is a __Warning__ or __Critical__ messages that is sent to users when the data source a user has selected exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The window of time indicates the interval by which these trigger conditions are checked. 

### Step 3: Set Rule Name

Create a unique name for your Alert and select additional tags that your team can use to sort and filter alerts with.

### Step 4: Select Notification Medium

Send your Alerts to specific Slack channels or email them directly to members of your organization.

### Step 5: Save Your Rule

Once you have finished configuring your rule, select __Create__. You have successfully created an Alert when it is visible on the home page in the Alerts table.
