title: Search & Filter
---

The Search & Filter features serve as the jumping-off point in your data exploration process within Middleware. Data is made available across all contexts within Middleware, allowing you to connect all data points collected.

The Filter Bar and Search Fields are two of the simplest methods for sifting through your data. They are both dynamically generated based on the applications, integrations, and infrastructure you have instrumented within Middleware. These features are inclusive (i.e. union set operations) and will display data that satisfies any of the selected filters.

# Using the Search bar

### Attribute to Value Matching

The search bar allows you to dynamically select data that has been generated within the page you are searching through. Your instrumented applications contain a default set of attributes that are collected and stored within Middleware that correspond to dynamically generated values.

Begin your search by clicking into the search bar, selecting your desired attribute, and then choosing a corresponding value that appears shortly after selecting said attribute:

### Logical Operators

Below is a table containing the available logical operators you can use within the search bar:

| __Operator__ | __Description__ |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| `AND`        | __Intersection__: Both terms must be present within the selected search |
| `OR`         | __Union__: Either term is contained within the selected search |

### Regex Operators

Regular Expression (Regex) operators allow you to identify specific patterns of strings within your instrumented application data. 

<Note> Refer to the following [Syntax Page]() to learn about the regex syntax that Middleware supports.</Note>

# Filtering Data with Attributes

The left navigation bar allows you to filter down the data being monitored within a given page. There are preset filters made available across different sections in Middleware as well as dynamically generated filters based on your component's different resource attributes.

To filter your data, check the boxes next to your desired filters to inclusively select the data you would like to view.

# Filtering by Date Range

All screens in Middleware include a date range picker in the top right. All other graphs within that dashboard will now be set to the time range you selected in that original graph. Select your own date range from the calendar or choose from our default options:

# History & Live Mode

Toggle between a static time range with the __History Mode__ or track your data in real-time with __Live Mode__. When you are in Live Mode your page will display the last 5 minutes of data while streaming in five second batches.

<Note>__Live Mode__ can be toggled on or off in the top right by clicking the __History/Live__ button. </Note>

# Timeframe Selection

All histograms in Middleware are capable of time range selection. Simply click and drag your cursor over the desired range to drill in:

# Filter By Project

Projects allow you to filter your team's data based on the projects your organization is working on. Projects give users the ability to silo the data they collect based on the teams that are working on and monitoring that data.

<Note> For more information on creating projects, navigate to the [Settings - Projects](https://docs.middleware.io/admin/settings/Projects) page. </Note>
