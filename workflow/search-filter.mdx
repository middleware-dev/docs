title: Search & Filter
---

The Search & Filter features serve as the jumping-off point in your data exploration process within Middleware. Data is made available across all contexts within Middleware, allowing you to connect all data points collected.

The Filter Bar and Search Fields are two of the simplest methods for sifting through your data. They are both dynamically generated based on the applications, integrations, and infrastructure you have instrumented within Middleware. These features are inclusive (i.e. union set operations) and will display data that satisfies any of the selected filters.

# Filtering by Date Range

All screens in Middleware include a date range picker in the top right. All other graphs within that dashboard will now be set to the time range you selected in that original graph. Select your own date range from the calendar or choose from our default options:

# Filter By Project

Projects allow you to filter your team's data based on the projects your organization is working on. Projects give users the ability to silo the data they collect based on the teams that are working on and monitoring that data.
