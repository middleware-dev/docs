title: Search & Filter
---

The Search & Filter features function as the jumping-off point in your data exploration process within Middleware. Data is made available across all contexts within Middleware, allowing you to understand the interconnectedness of your data.

<Note> For more information on log-based search, navigate to the [Log Monitoring - Search & Filter]() document to learn about our temporary log search solution.  </Note>

# Filtering & Search

The simplest way to filter your data is with the filter bar. The filter bar and search fields are dynamically generated based on the infrastructure you have instrumented within Middleware. These features are inclusive (aka union set operations) and will display data that satisfies any of the selected filters.

# Filtering by Date Range

Filter your data by date and time with the Date Range picker in the top right screen of all pages within Middleware. Select your own date range from the calendar or choose from our default options:

# History & Live View

Toggle between a static time range with the History View or track your data in real-time with Live View. 

<Note> When you select a specific date range, you will be viewing your data in History View. Select the date range you previously specified to switch back to Live View.</Note>

# Filtering Individual Graphs

To filter data within individual graphs, click and drag your cursor over the time range you are interested in. All other graphs within that dashboard will now be set to the time range you selected in that original graph.

# Filter By Project

Projects allow you to filter your team's data based on the projects your organization is working on. Projects give users the ability to silo the data they collect based on the teams that are working on and monitoring said data.

<Note> For more information on creating projects, navigate to the [Settings - Projects](https://docs.middleware.io/admin/settings/Projects) page. </Note>
